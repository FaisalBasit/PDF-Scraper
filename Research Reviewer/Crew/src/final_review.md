## A Comparative Review of Social Media's Impact on Adolescent and Young Adult Mental Health

Social media has become an omnipresent force in modern society, particularly among adolescents and young adults. Its pervasive influence has sparked considerable interest and concern regarding its potential effects on mental health. This review aims to comparatively analyze two research papers investigating this complex relationship: "The Impact of Social Media on Adolescent Mental Health" (Smith et al., 2023) and "Social Media Use and Depressive Symptoms in Young Adults: A Longitudinal Study" (Jones & Brown, 2024). While both studies explore the correlation between social media usage and mental well-being, they differ in their methodologies, target populations, and specific areas of focus, leading to nuanced insights into the broader issue.

Both Smith et al. (2023) and Jones & Brown (2024) contribute valuable data to the ongoing discussion about social media's impact on mental health. Both research teams started with the central premise that social media use and mental health are likely related, with both specifically examining symptoms of anxiety and depression in relation to social media habits. Both also ultimately suggest that interventions aimed at fostering healthier online habits and bolstering mental well-being are warranted. However, the approaches they took to testing this premise differed significantly.

The study by Smith et al. (2023) employed a cross-sectional survey design to examine the relationship between social media usage and mental health outcomes in a sample of 500 adolescents aged 13-18. Their research focused on identifying specific platforms, such as Instagram and TikTok, associated with higher rates of anxiety and depression. Furthermore, they explored the mediating role of perceived social support in this relationship. The findings revealed a significant positive correlation between social media usage and both anxiety and depression scores. They also concluded that perceived social support partially buffered the adverse effects of social media. These findings echo earlier concerns about the general well-being of "Generation Me" in the digital age (Twenge, 2006). The results of Smith et al. (2023) suggest that intervention strategies should focus on promoting healthy usage habits and strengthening perceived social support networks for adolescents.

In contrast, Jones & Brown (2024) adopted a longitudinal study design, tracking 400 young adults (18-25 years old) over two years to investigate the long-term effects of social media use on depressive symptoms. Their research distinguished between passive and active social media engagement, and also examined potential moderators such as self-esteem and social comparison tendencies. Their key finding was that increased social media use at baseline predicted higher levels of depressive symptoms at the two-year follow-up. Notably, they found that passive social media consumption was more strongly associated with depressive symptoms than active engagement. Furthermore, they identified low self-esteem and high social comparison tendencies as vulnerability factors. These findings align with research highlighting the negative impacts of social comparison on platforms like Facebook (Steers et al., 2014). Jones & Brown (2024) conclude that interventions should target social comparison tendencies and self-esteem to mitigate the adverse impacts of social media on young adults' mental health.

The differing methodologies employed by the two research teams provide complementary insights. Smith et al.â€™s (2023) cross-sectional approach offers a snapshot of the correlation between social media use and mental health in adolescents, quickly identifying high-risk platforms. However, its cross-sectional design limits its ability to establish causality. Jones & Brown's (2024) longitudinal study, on the other hand, provides a stronger basis for inferring causality, demonstrating how social media use can predict future depressive symptoms in young adults. While more time-consuming, this approach offers a more dynamic understanding of the relationship.

One notable difference lies in the specific aspects of social media use that each study emphasizes. Smith et al. (2023) pinpointed specific platforms (Instagram and TikTok) as particularly problematic, suggesting that the content and culture of these platforms may be especially detrimental to adolescent mental health. Jones & Brown (2024) moved beyond specific platforms to consider the *type* of engagement. Their finding that passive consumption is more harmful than active participation suggests that simply browsing and observing others' lives on social media can be more detrimental than actively creating content and interacting with others. This aligns with other work which suggests 'FOMO' or the 'fear of missing out' can be harmful and limiting usage can lead to less loneliness and depression (Hunt et al., 2018).

Another important divergence concerns the mediating and moderating factors investigated. Smith et al. (2023) focused on perceived social support as a mediator, suggesting that adolescents who feel supported in their offline lives may be better equipped to cope with the pressures of social media. Jones & Brown (2024), on the other hand, examined self-esteem and social comparison tendencies as moderators, indicating that individuals with low self-esteem and a tendency to compare themselves to others are more vulnerable to the negative effects of social media. Both findings are valuable, but they highlight different pathways through which social media can impact mental health. It's plausible that low self-esteem and social comparison tendencies could *also* mediate the relationship between social media use and *perceived* social support, opening opportunities for further research.

The research has some gaps. Both studies, for instance, could benefit from incorporating qualitative data to provide a richer understanding of the lived experiences of adolescents and young adults on social media. Future research could also explore the intersection of these findings, examining how platform choice, engagement type, perceived social support, self-esteem, and social comparison tendencies interact to influence mental health outcomes. Further research could also look into specific interventions, such as digital literacy programs or cognitive behavioral therapy techniques adapted for social media use, to promote healthier online habits and improve mental well-being. It is also critical to acknowledge that social media's impact is not universally negative; for some, it provides valuable social connection and access to information (Primack, et al., 2017; Orben, & Przybylski, A. K., 2019). A balanced approach is needed, recognizing both the risks and the potential benefits of social media use. Vogel et al. (2014) provides important context, noting the link between social comparison, social media, and self-esteem, factors important in interpreting these types of studies.

In conclusion, both Smith et al. (2023) and Jones & Brown (2024) provide important contributions to our understanding of the complex relationship between social media and mental health. Smith et al. highlight the correlation between social media use and mental health challenges, pointing to specific platforms of concern and the protective role of perceived social support in adolescents. Jones & Brown, through their longitudinal study, demonstrate the potential for social media use, particularly passive consumption, to predict future depressive symptoms in young adults, while emphasizing the moderating roles of self-esteem and social comparison. By comparing and contrasting these studies, we gain a more comprehensive understanding of the nuances of this relationship, highlighting the need for targeted interventions that address both individual vulnerabilities and the specific features of social media platforms that may contribute to mental health problems. Future research should build upon these findings to develop and evaluate effective strategies for promoting healthy social media habits and mitigating the risks to mental well-being.
