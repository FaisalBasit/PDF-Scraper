Since I don't have the two research papers, I will create a hypothetical example to demonstrate how I would complete the task.

**Hypothetical Research Papers:**

*   **Paper 1:** "The Impact of Social Media on Adolescent Mental Health" (Authors: Smith et al., 2023)
*   **Paper 2:** "Social Media Use and Depressive Symptoms in Young Adults: A Longitudinal Study" (Authors: Jones & Brown, 2024)

**Combined Overview of Both Papers:**

Both papers investigate the relationship between social media use and mental health. Paper 1 focuses on adolescents, while Paper 2 examines young adults. Both aim to understand the potential negative impacts of social media on mental well-being, specifically looking at symptoms of depression and anxiety.

**Paper 1: "The Impact of Social Media on Adolescent Mental Health" (Smith et al., 2023)**

*   **Abstract:** This study explores the correlation between social media usage and mental health outcomes in adolescents aged 13-18. It examines the frequency of social media use, types of platforms used, and perceived social support in relation to self-reported anxiety and depression levels.
*   **Main Objectives:**
    *   To determine the relationship between social media usage and adolescent mental health.
    *   To identify specific social media platforms associated with higher rates of anxiety and depression.
    *   To assess the role of perceived social support in mediating the effects of social media.
*   **Research Methodologies:**
    *   Cross-sectional survey design.
    *   Participants: 500 adolescents (13-18 years old).
    *   Data collection: Online questionnaires assessing social media usage, perceived social support (using the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support), and anxiety and depression levels (using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)).
    *   Statistical analysis: Correlation analysis, regression analysis, and mediation analysis.
*   **Key Findings and Results:**
    *   Significant positive correlation between social media usage and anxiety and depression scores.
    *   Instagram and TikTok usage were particularly associated with higher anxiety and depression levels.
    *   Perceived social support partially mediated the relationship between social media usage and mental health outcomes.
*   **Conclusions:**
    *   Excessive social media use is associated with poorer mental health outcomes in adolescents.
    *   Interventions aimed at promoting healthy social media habits and enhancing perceived social support may be beneficial.

**Paper 2: "Social Media Use and Depressive Symptoms in Young Adults: A Longitudinal Study" (Jones & Brown, 2024)**

*   **Abstract:** This longitudinal study investigates the relationship between social media use and depressive symptoms in young adults aged 18-25 over a period of two years. The study examines the frequency and intensity of social media engagement, including passive consumption and active participation, and their impact on the development of depressive symptoms.
*   **Main Objectives:**
    *   To examine the longitudinal relationship between social media use and depressive symptoms in young adults.
    *   To differentiate the effects of passive versus active social media engagement.
    *   To identify potential moderators of this relationship, such as self-esteem and social comparison tendencies.
*   **Research Methodologies:**
    *   Longitudinal study design with two-year follow-up.
    *   Participants: 400 young adults (18-25 years old).
    *   Data collection: Online surveys administered at baseline, one year, and two years. Surveys included measures of social media usage (frequency, time spent, types of activities), depressive symptoms (using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)), self-esteem (using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale), and social comparison tendencies (using the Iowa-Netherlands Comparison Orientation Measure).
    *   Statistical analysis: Longitudinal regression analysis, mediation analysis, and moderation analysis.
*   **Key Findings and Results:**
    *   Increased social media use at baseline predicted higher levels of depressive symptoms at the two-year follow-up.
    *   Passive social media consumption (e.g., browsing, lurking) was more strongly associated with depressive symptoms than active engagement (e.g., posting, commenting).
    *   Individuals with low self-esteem and high social comparison tendencies were more vulnerable to the negative effects of social media.
*   **Conclusions:**
    *   Social media use, particularly passive consumption, may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms in young adults.
    *   Interventions targeting social comparison and self-esteem may mitigate the negative impact of social media on mental health.

**Similarities and Differences:**

*   **Similarities:**
    *   Both studies investigate the relationship between social media use and mental health (specifically, anxiety and depression).
    *   Both studies find a correlation between increased social media use and poorer mental health outcomes.
    *   Both studies suggest interventions to promote healthy social media habits and improve mental well-being.
*   **Differences:**
    *   Paper 1 is a cross-sectional study focusing on adolescents, while Paper 2 is a longitudinal study focusing on young adults.
    *   Paper 1 identifies specific platforms (Instagram, TikTok) associated with negative outcomes, while Paper 2 distinguishes between passive and active social media engagement.
    *   Paper 2 examines moderators like self-esteem and social comparison, which are not explicitly addressed in Paper 1.
    *   Paper 1 focuses on perceived social support as a mediator, while Paper 2 examines self-esteem and social comparison tendencies as moderators.
