## A Comparative Review of AI Applications in Brain Tumor Imaging: Scope, Methodologies, and Bias Considerations

**Introduction**

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming medical imaging, offering unprecedented opportunities for improved diagnostics, treatment planning, and personalized medicine. In the realm of brain tumor imaging, AI, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is being explored for various applications. This review compares and contrasts two research papers that investigate the role of AI in brain tumor imaging: "Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging" by Chukwujindu et al. (2024) and "An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review" by Das et al. (2022). While both papers acknowledge the increasing significance of AI in this field, they differ in scope, methodology, and specific focus areas. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) provide a broad overview of AI applications, whereas Das et al. (2022) delve specifically into the risk of bias (RoB) associated with AI-driven brain tumor segmentation. This review aims to synthesize the findings of both papers, highlighting their overlapping themes, methodological differences, and implications for future research.

**Shared Themes and Overlapping Findings**

Both Chukwujindu et al. (2024) and Das et al. (2022) emphasize the transformative potential of AI in brain tumor imaging. They concur on several key points, including the increasing importance of ML and DL techniques for various aspects of brain tumor management. Accurate brain tumor *segmentation* is highlighted as a crucial step for diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring disease progression by both studies. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) discuss the role of AI in lesion detection, differential diagnosis, anatomical segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and pseudo-progression evaluation, showcasing a broad spectrum of applications. Das et al. (2022) focus more intently on the nuances of brain lesion segmentation (BLS) and the performance of different DL architectures. They both also acknowledge that MRI is a preferred imaging modality for brain tumor assessment because of its detailed visualization capabilities.

Both reviews also recognize the existing challenges in the implementation of AI. These challenges include data quality, standardization, and the need for robust, generalizable models. In particular, both papers touch upon the crucial aspect of data quality and availability. AI models are heavily dependent on large, well-annotated datasets for training, and variations in image acquisition protocols, patient populations, and annotation standards can significantly impact model performance. Overcoming these challenges is critical to realizing the full potential of AI in brain tumor imaging, as highlighted by Chukwujindu et al. (2024).

**Differences in Methods and Conclusions**

Despite sharing common ground, the two reviews diverge in their methodological approaches and specific conclusions. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) present a general overview of the literature, providing a comprehensive yet less granular perspective on the applications of AI in brain tumor imaging. In contrast, Das et al. (2022) adopt a more structured approach, employing a PRISMA strategy to select 75 relevant studies. They categorize these studies based on the architectural evolution of DL models, including CNN-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures.

A key distinction lies in the explicit focus on bias analysis in Das et al. (2022). They delve into the risk of bias in AI models for brain tumor segmentation, an area not explicitly addressed by Chukwujindu et al. (2024). Das et al. (2022) meticulously analyze AI attributes, compute a composite score, normalize, and rank studies based on bias. They provide specific recommendations for mitigating bias, emphasizing the importance of considering factors such as dataset diversity, algorithm transparency, and clinical validation. The lack of consideration of these biases may lead to overfitting or poor generalization performance of deep learning models as noted by Wadhwa et al. (2019).

Furthermore, Das et al. (2022) offer a performance ranking of DL architectures for BLS (TL > ED > CNN > HDL), which is absent in Chukwujindu et al. (2024). This ranking provides valuable insights into the relative strengths and weaknesses of different architectural approaches, helping researchers and clinicians make informed decisions about model selection. The superior performance of transfer learning might be related to the capacity to leverage pre-trained models on large datasets as identified by Karimi et al. (2021).

Chukwujindu et al. (2024) do, however, mention the promise of transformer-based networks in neuro-oncology imaging, a topic not explicitly covered by Das et al. (2022). This difference may be attributable to the earlier publication date of Das et al. (2022), as transformer networks have gained prominence more recently. Transformer networks have shown great promise in various medical imaging applications as shown by Zhu et al. (2022), due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information, and may be superior to CNNs.

Das et al. (2022) also incorporate clinical validation as one of the AI attributes in their risk-of-bias assessment. This highlights the importance of evaluating AI models not only on technical metrics but also on their clinical utility and impact on patient outcomes. Clinical validation helps ensure that AI models are reliable, accurate, and safe for use in real-world clinical settings, echoing the sentiment found in Chang et al. (2008).

**Contradictions, Gaps, and Future Research Implications**

While the two papers do not present direct contradictions, their differing scopes and methodologies reveal certain gaps and areas for future research. The primary gap is the lack of a comprehensive bias analysis in Chukwujindu et al. (2024). Given the increasing awareness of bias in AI, future reviews should incorporate a critical assessment of potential biases and their impact on the reliability and fairness of AI-driven brain tumor imaging.

Furthermore, both papers could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the ethical and regulatory considerations surrounding the use of AI in clinical practice. As AI becomes more integrated into healthcare, it is essential to address issues such as data privacy, algorithmic transparency, and accountability. Future research should explore these aspects to ensure that AI is used responsibly and ethically in brain tumor imaging.

Future research should focus on developing more robust and generalizable AI models that can overcome the limitations of current approaches. This includes addressing the challenges of data heterogeneity, improving model interpretability, and validating AI models in diverse clinical settings. Additionally, there is a need for more prospective studies that evaluate the impact of AI on patient outcomes and clinical workflows.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, both Chukwujindu et al. (2024) and Das et al. (2022) provide valuable insights into the evolving landscape of AI in brain tumor imaging. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) offer a broad overview of AI applications, while Das et al. (2022) delve into the critical issue of bias in brain tumor segmentation. By synthesizing the findings of both papers, this review highlights the transformative potential of AI, as well as the challenges and considerations that must be addressed to ensure its responsible and effective implementation. Future research should focus on addressing the identified gaps, particularly the need for comprehensive bias analysis and ethical considerations, to pave the way for AI-driven personalized medicine in brain tumor management. Overcoming these challenges is crucial to unlocking the full potential of AI and improving patient outcomes in the fight against brain tumors.
