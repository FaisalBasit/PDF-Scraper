# A Comparative Review of AI Applications in Brain Tumor Imaging: From Diagnosis to Segmentation

## Introduction

The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has ushered in a new era of possibilities across various domains, and medical imaging is no exception. Brain tumors, with their diverse characteristics and complex diagnostic pathways, have particularly benefited from the integration of AI-driven solutions. This review provides a comparative analysis of two research papers that explore the role of AI in brain tumor imaging. The first paper, "Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging" (European Journal of Radiology), offers a broad overview of AI applications in brain tumor imaging, encompassing lesion detection, differential diagnosis, and prognostication. The second paper, "An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review," delves into the specifics of AI frameworks for brain tumor segmentation (BTS), with a keen focus on deep learning (DL) architectures and the inherent risk of bias (RoB) associated with these models. While both papers acknowledge the transformative potential of AI in this field, they differ significantly in scope, methodology, and focus.

## Comparative Analysis of Findings and Methodologies

### Scope and Focus

The paper "Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging" presents a wide-ranging perspective on how AI, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), can assist in various aspects of brain tumor imaging. It considers applications from lesion detection using MRI, CT, and PET scan data to the identification of molecular markers and evaluation of pseudo-progression. Specific attention is given to both glioma and non-glioma brain tumors. The authors highlight how AI-driven extraction of imaging features can revolutionize radiological image analysis, making it more objective and quantifiable. Tools such as CAD systems are noted for their potential in improving the accuracy of detecting small metastatic brain lesions.

In contrast, "An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review" narrows its focus to brain tumor segmentation (BTS), a critical step in treatment planning and monitoring. This paper categorizes DL studies into CNN-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures. The central theme revolves around the risk of bias (RoB) in these AI architectures, analyzed through 32 AI attributes and a composite scoring system.

### Methodologies

Both papers adopt a review-based approach, synthesizing existing literature to provide insights into AI applications in brain tumor imaging. However, their methodologies diverge in structure and rigor. The first paper employs a narrative review methodology, summarizing and discussing findings from various studies without a predefined systematic approach. It highlights the potential of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT) in improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning.

The second paper, on the other hand, employs a more structured systematic review methodology, adhering to the PRISMA strategy. It analyzes 75 relevant studies, categorizing them into four DL-based segmentation model types. The risk of bias (RoB) analysis, using a ranking score method (RSM), adds a quantitative dimension to the review, enabling a comparative assessment of different AI architectures. This paper identifies that ED-based models have the lowest AI bias for BLS and provides recommendations for lowering the RoB.

### Key Findings and Results

The first paper concludes that AI has the potential to significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning for brain tumors. It emphasizes the transformation of radiological image analysis into a more objective and quantifiable task, leveraging AI to detect small lesions more effectively (Tandel et al., 2020). The use of AI-driven CAD tools can enhance the detection of metastatic brain lesions, contributing to improved patient outcomes (Yang, 2021).

The second paper's findings are more granular, offering a comparative performance analysis of different DL architectures for BTS. It identifies transfer learning (TL) as the best-performing architecture, followed by encoder-decoder (ED) models. The paper underscores the importance of considering and mitigating bias in AI models for BTS, with ED-based models exhibiting the lowest AI bias (Wadhwa et al., 2019). Statistical depth analysis, presented through pie charts and bar charts, illustrates the distributions of different parameters, providing a detailed insight into the models' performance.

## Contradictions, Gaps, and Future Research Implications

While both papers champion the role of AI in brain tumor imaging, some implicit contradictions and gaps warrant attention. The first paper broadly celebrates the potential of AI without delving deeply into the challenges of bias and variability in AI models. It does not offer a detailed critique of the limitations of current AI techniques.

The second paper addresses the crucial issue of bias but focuses primarily on segmentation, leaving other applications of AI in brain tumor imaging less explored. The categorization of DL architectures, while insightful, may oversimplify the complexity of hybrid models that combine elements from different classes.

Future research should focus on addressing these gaps. There is a need for studies that combine the broad scope of the first paper with the rigorous bias analysis of the second. Specifically, future work should:

*   Investigate the impact of AI bias on diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes in a comprehensive manner.
*   Develop strategies for mitigating bias in AI models across various applications, not just segmentation.
*   Explore the ethical implications of using AI in brain tumor imaging, including issues of data privacy, algorithmic transparency, and accountability.
*   Validate AI models on diverse patient populations to ensure generalizability and fairness (Grech et al., 2020).
*   Examine the clinical integration of AI tools, focusing on workflow optimization and user acceptance (Rowe, 2019).

## Conclusion

In summary, both "Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging" and "An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review" contribute valuable insights into the application of AI in brain tumor imaging. The first paper provides a broad overview of AI's potential in improving diagnosis and treatment planning, while the second paper delves into the specifics of AI frameworks for brain tumor segmentation, emphasizing the importance of bias analysis. While the first paper advocates for the transformative potential of AI in diagnostic accuracy and treatment strategies (Machado et al., 2020), the second paper calls for a more cautious and critical approach, highlighting the need to address and mitigate biases in AI models to ensure reliable and equitable outcomes (Karimi et al., 2021). Addressing the gaps and contradictions identified in this review is crucial for realizing the full potential of AI in brain tumor imaging and ensuring that these technologies are used responsibly and ethically (Price, 2006). Further research should integrate the broad scope of AI applications with rigorous bias analysis and validation across diverse patient populations, thus paving the way for personalized medicine and improved patient outcomes in the fight against brain tumors.
