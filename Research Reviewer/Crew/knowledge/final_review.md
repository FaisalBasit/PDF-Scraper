## A Comparative Review of AI Applications in Brain Tumor Imaging

### Introduction

The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging has seen exponential growth, promising to revolutionize diagnostics, treatment planning, and patient outcomes. This review comparatively analyzes two research papers that explore AI's role in brain tumor imaging. The first paper, "Role of Artificial Intelligence in Brain Tumour Imaging" by Chukwujindu et al. (2024), provides a broad overview of AI applications, including lesion detection, differential diagnosis, and prognostication, across both glioma and non-glioma tumors. The second paper, "An Artificial Intelligence Framework and Its Bias for Brain Tumor Segmentation: A Narrative Review" by Das et al. (2022), focuses specifically on brain tumor segmentation (BTS) using deep learning (DL) and examines the risk of bias associated with different AI architectural models. Both papers contribute significantly to understanding the current landscape and future directions of AI in this critical area of medical imaging.

### Comparative Analysis of Findings and Methodologies

Both Chukwujindu et al. (2024) and Das et al. (2022) recognize the transformative potential of AI, particularly deep learning, in brain tumor imaging. They both highlight the ability of AI to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are acknowledged by both as fundamental AI architectures. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) emphasize that AI-driven extraction of imaging features transforms radiological image analysis from qualitative to objective and quantifiable, paving the way for personalized medicine. Similarly, Das et al. (2022) underscore DL's efficiency in BTS due to its automatic feature extraction capabilities.

However, the two papers differ significantly in their scope and focus. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) offer a wider perspective, covering various AI applications in both glioma and non-glioma brain tumors, including molecular marker identification and pseudo-progression evaluation. They note the potential of CAD tools to improve diagnostic accuracy in detecting small metastatic brain lesions. In contrast, Das et al. (2022) narrow their focus to BTS, specifically addressing the critical issue of bias in different DL architectures.

Methodologically, Chukwujindu et al. (2024) present a general review of existing literature, synthesizing findings across a broad spectrum of AI applications. They used ChatGPT to analyze articles and retrieve findings, taking responsibility for the content. On the other hand, Das et al. (2022) employ a more systematic approach, utilizing the PRISMA framework to analyze 75 relevant studies identified through searches of PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Their quantitative bias analysis, categorizing DL models into CNN-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures, represents a significant contribution to understanding the limitations and potential pitfalls of AI in BTS. They assessed AI bias using 32 AI attributes, computing a composite score to rank studies by bias level. Their findings indicated that TL-based models generally performed best, while ED-based models exhibited the lowest AI bias for BLS.

A key difference lies in the explicit consideration of bias. Das et al. (2022) meticulously analyze the risk of bias (RoB) associated with different AI models for BTS, offering recommendations for mitigating these biases. This is not a central focus in Chukwujindu et al. (2024), although they acknowledge the challenges and limitations of AI implementation in radiology. Furthermore, Chukwujindu et al. (2024) specifically highlight the promise of transformer-based networks, a detail not extensively covered by Das et al. (2022). Studies such as G.S. Tandel et al. (2020) and Y. Yang (2021), referenced in Chukwujindu et al. (2024), likely contribute to this perspective on transformer networks, reflecting the rapid advancements in the field since the publication of Das et al. (2022).

### Contradictions, Gaps, and Future Research Implications

While both papers champion the use of AI, neither shies away from acknowledging its limitations. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) allude to the challenges of AI implementation, implicitly recognizing potential biases and the need for careful validation. Das et al. (2022) explicitly address the risk of bias, revealing a critical gap in the application of AI in BTS. Their bias analysis suggests that certain architectures (e.g., HDL-based) may be more prone to bias than others (e.g., ED-based). This finding underscores the importance of rigorous evaluation and validation of AI models before clinical deployment.

One potential contradiction arises from the differing scopes of the reviews. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) paint a broad picture of AI's potential, while Das et al. (2022) offer a more cautionary perspective, highlighting the risks of bias in a specific application (BTS). However, this is less a contradiction and more a difference in focus, with both perspectives being crucial for a balanced understanding.

Future research implications are significant. Das et al. (2022) present primary and secondary recommendations for lowering the RoB, providing a roadmap for future studies aimed at developing more robust and unbiased AI models for BTS. The emphasis on transfer learning (TL) as a high-performing architecture also suggests that further exploration of TL techniques could yield significant improvements in BTS accuracy and reliability, building upon works such as A. Wadhwa et al. (2019) and K. Kamnitsas et al. (2017), as referenced by Das et al. (2022). Chukwujindu et al. (2024)'s mention of transformer networks suggests that this is an area ripe for further investigation, particularly in the context of brain tumor imaging, diagnosis, and prognostication. The role of AI in detecting small metastatic brain lesions, highlighted by Chukwujindu et al. (2024), also warrants further research to improve early detection and treatment planning.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, both Chukwujindu et al. (2024) and Das et al. (2022) offer valuable insights into the application of AI in brain tumor imaging. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) provide a comprehensive overview of AI's potential across various applications, from lesion detection to prognostication, acknowledging the transformative impact of AI-driven image analysis. Das et al. (2022) delve deeper into the specific application of brain tumor segmentation, offering a critical analysis of bias in different AI architectures and providing recommendations for future research. The synthesis of these two perspectives underscores the immense promise of AI in brain tumor imaging while also highlighting the importance of addressing potential biases and limitations. Future research should focus on developing robust, unbiased AI models, exploring the potential of transformer networks, and validating AI tools rigorously before clinical implementation. As AI continues to evolve, its responsible and ethical application will be crucial to realizing its full potential in improving patient outcomes.
