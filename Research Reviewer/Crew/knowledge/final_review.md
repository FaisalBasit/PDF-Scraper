## A Comparative Review of AI Applications and Bias in Brain Tumor Imaging

### Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is rapidly transforming medical imaging. Both Chukwujindu et al. (2024) and Das et al. (2022) explore the burgeoning role of AI in brain tumor imaging. While both papers acknowledge the potential benefits of AI in this domain, they approach the topic from different angles. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) provide a broad overview of AI applications, encompassing lesion detection, differential diagnosis, anatomic segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and pseudo-progression evaluation. Their review considers both glioma and non-glioma tumors and touches on the use of transformer networks. Conversely, Das et al. (2022) delve deeply into the specific area of brain tumor segmentation (BTS) and conduct a risk-of-bias (RoB) analysis across various deep learning architectures. This review aims to compare and contrast these two papers, highlighting their findings, methodologies, and conclusions, while also addressing potential contradictions and future research directions.

### Comparative Analysis of Findings and Methodologies

Both Chukwujindu et al. (2024) and Das et al. (2022) recognize the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as a fundamental architecture in brain tumor image analysis. However, their methodologies and scope diverge significantly. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) adopt a broad review approach, synthesizing existing literature to illustrate the diverse applications of AI in neuro-oncology. They highlight how AI-driven extraction of imaging features is transforming radiological image analysis and improving diagnostic accuracy (Chukwujindu et al., 2024). This is supported by previous research into computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools and their ability to enhance the detection of small metastatic brain lesions (G.S. Tandel et al., 2020). The paper also explores how AI can aid in early and accurate treatment planning, which is crucial for procedures like stereotactic radiosurgery.

Das et al. (2022), on the other hand, employ a more structured approach. They utilize the PRISMA methodology to analyze 75 relevant studies, categorizing DL studies into CNN-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures. Their analysis considers 32 AI attributes to compute a composite bias score, ultimately ranking studies based on their risk of bias. A key finding of Das et al. (2022) is the comparative performance of different architectures, revealing that transfer learning (TL) models generally perform best for BTS, followed by encoder-decoder (ED) models. Furthermore, their results suggest that ED-based models exhibit the lowest AI bias for BLS. This focus on architectural bias represents a critical contribution to the field, emphasizing the importance of not only developing accurate AI models but also ensuring their reliability and fairness.

While Chukwujindu et al. (2024) mention the potential of transformer networks in neuro-oncology imaging, Das et al. (2022) do not focus on this specific architecture. This difference in emphasis reflects the evolving landscape of AI in medical imaging, with transformer networks gaining increasing attention more recently. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) reference the improvements AI can bring to diagnostic accuracy (M. Cè, 2023) whereas Das et al. (2022) focus more specifically on the bias element with AI implementation, drawing upon studies such as A. Wadhwa et al. (2019).

### Discussion of Contradictions, Gaps, and Future Research

There are no direct contradictions between the two papers, as they address different but related aspects of AI in brain tumor imaging. However, the differing scopes highlight a gap in the literature: a comprehensive analysis that combines the broad overview of AI applications provided by Chukwujindu et al. (2024) with the rigorous risk-of-bias assessment conducted by Das et al. (2022). Future research should aim to bridge this gap by evaluating the bias associated with different AI applications (beyond just segmentation) and across various tumor types (gliomas vs. non-gliomas).

Moreover, both papers acknowledge the challenges and limitations of AI in radiology. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) implicitly recognize this by calling for improved AI tools for diagnostic accuracy, while Das et al. (2022) explicitly address the risk of bias. Future research needs to focus on developing strategies to mitigate bias in AI models, ensuring that these models are generalizable across diverse patient populations and imaging protocols. As Das et al. (2022) emphasize, understanding and addressing bias is crucial for the responsible and ethical implementation of AI in clinical practice. Further work may need to address the black box problem, as well as the requirement for large training datasets (Y. Yang, 2021).

Furthermore, the integration of AI with other imaging modalities, such as molecular imaging, presents another avenue for future exploration. As Chukwujindu et al. (2024) note, AI has the potential to aid in molecular marker identification. Investigating how AI can combine information from different imaging modalities to improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy is a promising area for future research (Blanc-Durand et al.).

### Conclusion

In conclusion, both Chukwujindu et al. (2024) and Das et al. (2022) contribute valuable insights into the application of AI in brain tumor imaging. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) provide a broad overview of the diverse applications of AI, emphasizing its potential to improve diagnosis, treatment planning, and personalized medicine. Das et al. (2022) offer a more focused analysis of brain tumor segmentation, highlighting the importance of addressing and mitigating bias in AI models.

While Chukwujindu et al. paint a picture of AI's broad applicability, Das et al. provide a crucial cautionary note regarding the limitations of these systems as they are currently implemented. The papers collectively highlight the need for continued research and development in this field, with a particular focus on bridging the gap between broad application and rigorous bias assessment. By combining the insights from both papers, researchers can work towards developing more accurate, reliable, and equitable AI solutions for brain tumor imaging, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes. The path forward requires a synthesis of expansive application exploration and focused bias mitigation strategies to ensure AI’s promise is realized responsibly.
