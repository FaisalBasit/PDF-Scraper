## A Comparative Review of AI Applications in Brain Tumor Imaging

**Introduction**

Brain tumors pose a significant challenge in medical diagnostics and treatment planning. The increasing incidence of these tumors necessitates the development of advanced tools for early and accurate diagnosis. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), has emerged as a promising solution for improving brain tumor imaging. This review compares and contrasts two research papers that explore the role of AI in this domain. The first paper, "Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging" by Chukwujindu et al. (2024), provides a broad overview of AI applications in brain tumor imaging, encompassing lesion detection, differential diagnosis, anatomic segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and pseudo-progression evaluation. The second paper, "An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review" by Das et al. (2022), concentrates specifically on brain lesion segmentation (BLS) and presents a risk-of-bias analysis of different DL architectures used for this purpose. Both papers recognize the potential of AI in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of brain tumor management, yet they differ in scope, methodology, and focus.

**Comparison of Findings and Methodologies**

Chukwujindu et al. (2024) offer a wide-ranging review of AI applications in brain tumor imaging, highlighting the use of AI in improving the diagnosis of small lesions using MRI, CT, and PET scan data. They emphasize that AI-driven extraction of imaging features is transforming radiological image analysis. This review also covers the development of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools, which can improve diagnostic accuracy in detecting small metastatic brain lesions, allowing for early and accurate treatment planning. The authors further note the promise of transformer networks in this field. The breadth of this paper is evident in its consideration of both glioma and non-glioma tumors, providing a holistic view of AI's impact.

In contrast, Das et al. (2022) adopt a more focused approach, concentrating solely on brain lesion segmentation (BLS). Their study uses a structured PRISMA strategy to select and analyze 75 relevant studies, categorizing DL architectures into CNN-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based models. A key finding of their research is the performance ranking of these architectures, from best to worst: TL > ED > CNN > HDL. Notably, they found that ED-based models had the lowest AI bias for BLS. Their methodology includes a detailed risk-of-bias analysis (RoB) using an AP(ai)Bias 1.0 based on a ranking score method (RSM), providing a quantitative assessment of bias in different AI models.

Both papers acknowledge the role of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in brain tumor imaging. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) mention CNNs as one of the AI techniques used for various tasks, while Das et al. (2022) specifically categorize CNN-based architectures in their analysis of BLS models. This overlap underscores the widespread use and importance of CNNs in the field.

A significant difference lies in the methodological approach. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) conduct a general literature review, synthesizing findings from various studies to provide an overview of AI applications. Das et al. (2022), on the other hand, employ a more rigorous and systematic approach, using the PRISMA guidelines and a defined set of criteria for study selection and bias assessment. This structured methodology allows Das et al. (2022) to provide a more granular analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of different DL architectures.

**Contradictions, Gaps, and Future Research Implications**

While both papers highlight the potential of AI, they also indirectly point to some contradictions and gaps in the current research landscape. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) mention the challenges related to data quality, seamless workflow integration, and generalizability of AI methods across diverse settings and population groups. These challenges are echoed in the bias analysis conducted by Das et al. (2022), which reveals varying levels of bias in different DL architectures.

The RoB analysis by Das et al. (2022) exposes a critical gap in the field: the lack of standardized methods for evaluating and mitigating bias in AI models for brain tumor imaging. Their study presents a set of three primary and six secondary recommendations for lowering the RoB, which is a valuable contribution to addressing this gap.

Furthermore, the two papers offer insights into potential avenues for future research. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) highlight the promise of transformer networks, suggesting that further research is needed to explore the full potential of these architectures in brain tumor imaging. Das et al. (2022) emphasize the need for developing more robust and less biased AI models for BLS, particularly through the use of transfer learning (TL) and encoder-decoder (ED) architectures.

Several references from both papers point to areas of ongoing research and development. For instance, the work of Tandel et al. (2020) mentioned by Chukwujindu et al., likely explores specific applications of AI in brain tumor diagnosis, while the study by Kamnitsas et al. (2017) referenced by Das et al., probably investigates particular DL techniques for segmentation. These references, alongside others like Yang (2021), Machado et al. (2020) from Chukwujindu's paper, and Wadhwa et al. (2019) from Das' paper, provide a detailed backdrop of the existing research and future directions.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, both Chukwujindu et al. (2024) and Das et al. (2022) provide valuable insights into the role of AI in brain tumor imaging. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) offer a broad overview of AI applications, highlighting its potential to improve diagnostic accuracy, treatment planning, and personalized medicine. Das et al. (2022) provide a more focused analysis of brain lesion segmentation, emphasizing the importance of addressing bias in AI models. While Chukwujindu et al. touch upon the general challenges of AI implementation, Das et al. delve deeper, providing a structured risk-of-bias analysis and offering recommendations for mitigating bias. Both papers underscore the transformative potential of AI in brain tumor management, while also acknowledging the challenges that must be addressed to ensure its effective and equitable implementation. The synthesis of these perspectives suggests that future research should focus on developing robust, generalizable, and less biased AI models, with a particular emphasis on transformer networks and transfer learning techniques. Ultimately, the successful integration of AI into clinical practice will require a multidisciplinary approach, involving radiologists, computer scientists, and other healthcare professionals, to ensure that these technologies are used responsibly and ethically to improve patient outcomes.
