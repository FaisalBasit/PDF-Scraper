## A Comparative Review of AI Applications in Brain Tumor Imaging: Scope, Methodologies, and Future Directions

**Introduction**

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming medical imaging, offering the potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, streamline workflows, and personalize treatment strategies. This review compares and contrasts two research papers that investigate the application of AI in brain tumor imaging. The first paper provides a broad overview of AI techniques in brain tumor imaging, while the second delves specifically into the critical area of brain tumor segmentation (BTS) and the inherent biases within AI models used for this purpose. Both papers acknowledge the growing significance of AI, particularly deep learning, in this field, but they differ in scope, methodology, and emphasis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a key modality discussed in both papers.

**Scope and Focus**

The review "Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging" presents a comprehensive landscape of AI applications in brain tumor imaging. It explores various AI techniques, including machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and transformer networks, addressing tasks such as lesion detection, diagnosis, and prognostication. The review encompasses both glioma and non-glioma tumors, offering a holistic perspective on the field. In contrast, "An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review" narrows its focus to brain tumor segmentation using deep learning algorithms. This paper categorizes different deep learning architectures employed for segmentation, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), encoder-decoder models (EDs), transfer learning (TL), and hybrid deep learning (HDL) architectures. A key distinguishing feature is its emphasis on analyzing and quantifying the risk of bias inherent in these AI models, an aspect not as prominently featured in the first paper. The first paper emphasizes personalized medicine as a key outcome for the field.

**Methodologies**

Both papers adopt a literature review approach, synthesizing findings from multiple studies to provide an overview of the current state of AI in brain tumor imaging. However, their methodologies diverge in terms of structure and depth. The first paper follows a general review approach, summarizing key research findings and highlighting potential applications. The second paper employs a more structured methodology, adhering to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. It incorporates a quantitative bias analysis, assessing 32 AI attributes to evaluate the risk of bias in the included studies. This systematic approach allows for a more rigorous and objective evaluation of the existing literature on brain tumor segmentation.

**Findings and Architectural Classifications**

Both reviews highlight the potential of AI to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning for brain tumors. Accurate and fast brain tumor segmentation is a key element for achieving this. The first paper acknowledges the promise of AI in enhancing diagnostic capabilities, while the second paper provides a more in-depth analysis of the performance of different deep learning architectures for segmentation. Specifically, the second paper finds that transfer learning (TL) architectures generally outperform encoder-decoder (ED) models, which in turn outperform CNN and HDL architectures (TL > ED > CNN > HDL). Interestingly, the second paper suggests that ED-based models tend to exhibit the lowest AI bias. This detailed comparison of architectural performance and bias is a significant contribution of the second paper.

**Contradictions, Gaps, and Future Research**

While both papers agree on the overall potential of AI, there are some subtle differences in their perspectives. The first paper, with its broader scope, emphasizes the potential for personalized medicine through AI-driven diagnostics and prognostics. The second paper, focusing on segmentation and bias, underscores the critical need to address and mitigate biases in AI models to ensure equitable and reliable clinical application. One potential gap identified is the limited discussion of transformer networks in the second paper, given their increasing prominence in various AI applications, as mentioned in the first paper. This might be due to the specific focus on segmentation, where other architectures have historically been more prevalent. Future research should focus on further exploring the application of transformer networks in brain tumor segmentation and evaluating their performance and bias characteristics. Additional gaps might exist in the reproducibility of studies, as highlighted by the systematic approach employed by the second paper when assessing bias using 32 AI attributes, which should be acknowledged in future reviews of similar topics.

Moreover, both papers implicitly highlight the need for larger, more diverse, and well-annotated datasets to train and validate AI models. Addressing data biases and ensuring the generalizability of AI models across different patient populations remain crucial challenges. Further research is also needed to evaluate the clinical impact of AI-driven tools in real-world settings, assessing their effectiveness in improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, both research papers provide valuable insights into the application of AI in brain tumor imaging. The first paper offers a broad overview of the field, highlighting the potential of AI to enhance diagnostics, prognostics, and personalized medicine. The second paper provides a more focused and in-depth analysis of brain tumor segmentation, emphasizing the importance of addressing biases in AI models. By comparing and contrasting these two perspectives, this review has identified key similarities, differences, and future research directions. Moving forward, it is essential to continue developing and refining AI algorithms, while also addressing the ethical and practical considerations surrounding their implementation in clinical practice (Aneja et al., Dec. 2019; Rowe, Oct. 2019). Further research should focus on validating these models on diverse datasets and rigorously evaluating their clinical impact to ensure that AI truly benefits patients with brain tumors (Wadhwa et al., Sep 2019; Yang, Dec. 2021). As technology evolves, continuous assessment and refinement of AI techniques will be crucial to maximize their potential and minimize potential risks in brain tumor imaging and treatment (Zhu, Aug. 2022).
