## A Comparative Review of AI Applications in Brain Tumor Imaging and Segmentation

**Introduction**

Brain tumors represent a significant clinical challenge, necessitating accurate and timely diagnosis and treatment. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising avenues for improving various aspects of brain tumor management, from initial detection to prognostication. This review comparatively analyzes two recent papers that address the application of AI in brain tumor imaging. The first paper, "Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging" by Chukwujindu et al. (2024), provides a broad overview of AI techniques and their applications in brain tumor imaging. The second paper, "An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review" by Das et al. (2022), narrows its focus to AI-based brain tumor segmentation (BTS), with a particular emphasis on deep learning (DL) models and the associated risk of bias (RoB). This review will compare and contrast the findings, methodologies, and conclusions of these two papers, highlighting key similarities, differences, and implications for future research.

**Comparative Analysis of Findings and Methodologies**

Both papers acknowledge the increasing importance of AI in neuro-oncology. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) present a wide-ranging discussion of how AI, incorporating both machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), can assist in various aspects of brain tumor imaging, including lesion detection, differential diagnosis, anatomic segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and pseudo-progression evaluation. They note that AI can transform radiological image analysis from qualitative interpretation to an objective, quantifiable, and reproducible task. This aligns with the broader trend of leveraging AI to enhance diagnostic accuracy, particularly for detecting small metastatic brain lesions. The authors also uniquely address AI applications in non-glioma brain tumors, such as metastatic tumors, meningiomas, and pituitary tumors, recognizing the diverse landscape of brain neoplasms that benefit from improved classification for optimal treatment strategies. They also consider the use of transformer-based neural networks in brain tumour imaging.

Das et al. (2022), on the other hand, delve specifically into AI-driven brain tumor segmentation, a critical step in treatment planning and monitoring. They categorize DL studies into CNN-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures. Their work is distinguished by a systematic risk-of-bias (RoB) analysis, based on PRISMA guidelines, of AI models for BTS, examining 75 relevant studies through 32 AI attributes. This in-depth RoB assessment is a significant contribution, addressing a key concern in the application of AI to medical imaging. Their findings suggest that ED-based models exhibit the lowest AI bias for brain lesion segmentation (BLS). Also, the search strategy using the PRISMA model helps improve the reproducibility of the review.

A key difference lies in the scope. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) offer a comprehensive overview, while Das et al. (2022) provide a focused, systematic review and meta-analysis of bias in BTS. While both papers highlight the importance of ML and DL, Das et al. (2022) provide a more granular classification of DL architectures. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) mention convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) as examples of AI in image analysis, but Das et al. (2022) systematically categorize DL models and analyze their biases.

Methodologically, Chukwujindu et al. (2024) present a narrative review discussing AI applications. Das et al. (2022) employ a more rigorous systematic review based on PRISMA guidelines, analyzing a substantial number of studies to evaluate AI bias. This difference in methodology reflects the papers' respective focuses: a broad overview versus a focused analysis of a specific issue.

**Contradictions, Gaps, and Future Research Implications**

While the papers do not present direct contradictions, they address different facets of the AI in brain tumor imaging landscape. A potential gap lies in the integration of bias analysis across all AI applications in brain tumor imaging. Das et al. (2022) provide valuable insights into bias in BTS, but similar analyses are needed for other applications, such as lesion detection and differential diagnosis, as highlighted by Chukwujindu et al. (2024).

Future research should focus on several key areas. First, developing more robust and generalizable AI models is crucial. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) emphasize the need for high-quality data and seamless integration into clinical workflows. Addressing bias in AI models, as highlighted by Das et al. (2022), is also paramount. Their recommendation for lowering the RoB should be considered for future research. Second, further exploration of transformer-based networks, as mentioned by Chukwujindu et al. (2024), could lead to advancements in brain tumor diagnosis and treatment. Finally, investigating AI applications in non-glioma brain tumors, an area explicitly addressed by Chukwujindu et al. (2024), warrants further attention. Research by Tandel et al. (2020) and Yang (2021) likely provided foundational context for the AI methodologies discussed in both papers, underscoring the iterative nature of AI development in this field. Furthermore, the importance of accurate glioma grading, as highlighted by Chukwujindu et al. (2024) and the challenges in HGG segmentation discussed by Das et al. (2022) highlight the continuing need for advancements in these areas. The work of Wesseling et al. (2018) on neuropathology likely provides a key reference for understanding tumor grading standards.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, both Chukwujindu et al. (2024) and Das et al. (2022) contribute valuable insights into the role of AI in brain tumor imaging. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) provide a broad overview of AI applications, emphasizing the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and transform radiological image analysis. Das et al. (2022) offer a focused analysis of AI-based brain tumor segmentation, with a critical assessment of the risk of bias in DL models. While Chukwujindu et al. (2024) touch upon the significance of AI in the diagnosis of non-glioma tumors, Das et al. (2022) concentrate primarily on gliomas. The strengths of one paper complement the other, providing a comprehensive understanding of the field. By addressing the limitations and biases of AI models, researchers can pave the way for more reliable and clinically useful tools. Future research should focus on developing robust, generalizable, and unbiased AI models that can be seamlessly integrated into clinical workflows to improve the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors.
