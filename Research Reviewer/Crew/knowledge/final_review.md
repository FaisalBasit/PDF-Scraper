### A Comparative Review of AI Applications in Brain Tumor Imaging and Segmentation

**Introduction**

Brain tumors present a significant clinical challenge, demanding accurate and timely diagnosis and treatment planning. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), has emerged as a promising tool to aid in various aspects of brain tumor imaging. This review comparatively analyzes two recent papers that explore the role of AI in this domain. The first paper, "Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging" by Chukwujindu et al. (2024), offers a broad overview of AI applications in brain tumor imaging, including lesion detection, differential diagnosis, and prognostication. The second paper, "An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review" by Das et al. (2022), focuses specifically on brain tumor segmentation (BTS) using AI and examines potential biases associated with different AI architectures. By synthesizing these two perspectives, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state and future directions of AI in brain tumor imaging.

**Comparison of Methodologies and Scope**

Both Chukwujindu et al. (2024) and Das et al. (2022) recognize the transformative potential of AI in improving the accuracy and efficiency of brain tumor diagnosis and treatment. Both reviews emphasize the importance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a crucial modality for brain tumor imaging. Additionally, they acknowledge the significance of feature extraction techniques in brain tumor segmentation.

However, the two papers differ significantly in their scope and methodologies. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) present a broad review of AI applications, encompassing lesion detection, differential diagnosis, anatomical segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and pseudo-progression evaluation across various tumor types, including gliomas and non-gliomas. Their methodology involves a comprehensive literature search and synthesis of existing research. They discuss the role of transformer-based networks, highlighting their potential in neuro-oncology imaging. In contrast, Das et al. (2022) adopt a more focused approach, concentrating specifically on brain tumor *segmentation* and the biases associated with different DL architectures. Their study employs a systematic review and meta-analysis approach, adhering to PRISMA guidelines. They analyze 75 relevant studies, categorizing DL studies into four architectural classes: convolutional neural network (CNN)-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures. They assess these studies based on 32 AI attributes and use a ranking score method (RSM) to determine bias levels.

**Findings and Results: A Comparative Analysis**

Chukwujindu et al. (2024) highlight AI's capability to enhance the detection of small lesions using MRI, CT, and PET scan data. They emphasize the shift from qualitative interpretation to objective, quantifiable tasks through AI-driven radiological image analysis. The review points out the need for accurate tuning of CAD (Computer-Aided Detection) tools to avoid overdiagnosis and overtreatment. They also mention the potential of transformer networks, which have shown promise in various medical imaging applications (M. Zhu, 2022).

Das et al. (2022) provide a more granular analysis of DL architectures for BTS. Their study reveals that transfer learning (TL) architectures exhibit the best performance, followed by encoder-decoder (ED), CNN, and hybrid DL (HDL) architectures. ED-based models demonstrate the lowest AI bias for BLS. The review offers specific recommendations for mitigating the risk of bias (RoB) in AI for BTS, suggesting strategies to improve the reliability and generalizability of these models. Their analysis provides statistical distributions of AI attributes in BLS for different DL architectures, offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners.

**Contradictions, Gaps, and Future Research Implications**

While both papers advocate for the use of AI in brain tumor imaging, they implicitly highlight different challenges and areas for improvement. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) emphasize the need for careful tuning of CAD tools to prevent overdiagnosis, suggesting a potential gap in the current understanding of optimal AI deployment in clinical settings. Das et al. (2022) explicitly address the issue of bias in AI models, revealing that different architectures exhibit varying levels of bias. This underscores the importance of addressing bias to ensure equitable and reliable AI performance across diverse patient populations.

Future research should focus on addressing these gaps. Studies are needed to optimize CAD tools for brain tumor imaging, balancing sensitivity and specificity to minimize overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Further investigation into the sources of bias in AI models for BTS is essential, along with the development of strategies to mitigate these biases. The exploration of transformer networks in neuro-oncology imaging, as mentioned by Chukwujindu et al. (2024), warrants further attention, given their potential to capture long-range dependencies and improve segmentation accuracy. Moreover, prospective clinical trials are needed to evaluate the real-world impact of AI-based tools on patient outcomes.

**Synthesis and Conclusion**

In conclusion, both Chukwujindu et al. (2024) and Das et al. (2022) contribute valuable insights into the application of AI in brain tumor imaging. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) provide a broad overview of AI's potential across various aspects of brain tumor management, while Das et al. (2022) offer a focused analysis of AI architectures for BTS and the associated biases. These papers collectively highlight the transformative potential of AI in improving diagnostic accuracy, treatment planning, and patient outcomes. However, they also underscore the importance of addressing challenges related to bias, overdiagnosis, and the need for rigorous validation in clinical settings. As AI technology continues to evolve, future research should focus on these critical areas to ensure the responsible and effective implementation of AI in brain tumor imaging. The promise of personalized medicine (Chukwujindu et al., 2024) hinges on the continued development and refinement of these AI tools, paving the way for more precise and tailored treatment strategies for patients with brain tumors.
