## A Comparative Review of AI Applications and Bias in Brain Tumor Imaging

### Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming medical imaging, offering powerful tools for diagnosis, treatment planning, and prognostication. This review comparatively analyzes two research papers focusing on AI applications in brain tumor imaging. The first paper, "Role of Artificial Intelligence in Brain Tumour Imaging" (European Journal of Radiology, 2024), provides a broad overview of AI's role in various aspects of brain tumor management. The second, "An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review" (Computers in Biology and Medicine, 2022), delves specifically into AI bias within deep learning (DL) frameworks used for brain tumor segmentation (BTS). Both papers highlight the potential of AI while also addressing the challenges and limitations associated with its implementation in clinical practice. This review will synthesize the findings of these two papers, exploring their shared themes, methodological differences, and implications for future research in the field.

### Comparative Analysis of Findings and Methodologies

Both papers recognize the pivotal role of AI, and particularly deep learning (DL), in revolutionizing brain tumor imaging. They converge on the importance of brain tumor segmentation (BTS) as a critical application area. Both reviews also discuss the ubiquitous presence of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in medical image analysis. The 2024 paper emphasizes AI’s power to improve the diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning, echoing the sentiment for early and precise interventions.

However, the scope and methodologies of the two papers diverge significantly. The 2024 paper offers a wide-ranging review of AI applications, covering lesion detection, differential diagnosis, anatomic segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and pseudo-progression evaluation in both glioma and non-glioma tumors. It also touches upon the promising role of transformers in neuro-oncology imaging. In contrast, the 2022 paper adopts a more focused approach, scrutinizing AI bias within different DL architectures (CNN, Encoder-Decoder (ED), Transfer Learning (TL), and Hybrid DL (HDL)) specifically for BTS.

The methodologies employed also differ markedly. The 2024 paper synthesizes findings from existing literature to provide a general overview of AI in brain tumor imaging. It does not employ a structured quantitative method. Conversely, the 2022 paper adopts a structured approach based on the PRISMA strategy, analyzing 75 relevant studies and categorizing DL studies into four classes based on architectural evolution. The authors analyze these studies considering 32 AI attributes, including AI architecture, imaging modalities, hyper-parameters, performance evaluation metrics, and clinical evaluation. They then use a ranking score method (RSM) to estimate the risk of bias (RoB). This more granular methodology enables the 2022 paper to provide specific recommendations for mitigating AI bias.

Key findings also differ. The 2024 paper concludes that AI has the potential to improve diagnosis and treatment, paving the way for personalized medicine. It highlights that AI-driven extraction of imaging features can transform radiological image analysis (G.S. Tandel et al., 2020). It also states that CAD tools can improve diagnostic accuracy in detecting small metastatic brain lesions, which is essential for early and accurate treatment planning, especially for stereotactic radiosurgery. The 2022 paper, on the other hand, ranks DL architectures based on performance and AI bias, concluding that TL and ED architectures perform best and exhibit the lowest AI bias. The 2022 paper provides a set of recommendations for lowering the RoB.

### Discussion of Contradictions, Gaps, and Future Research Implications

While the two papers do not present direct contradictions, their different focuses reveal gaps and areas for future research. The broader scope of the 2024 paper means it implicitly addresses the issue of bias through discussions of data quality and standardization, whereas the 2022 paper explicitly assesses and ranks AI bias. This explicit assessment underscores the critical need for addressing bias in AI models to ensure reliable and equitable clinical application. Future research should focus on developing methods to reduce bias in AI models for brain tumor imaging.

The 2022 paper highlights a potential gap in the implementation of hybrid DL architectures (HDL), as these were found to be the worst-performing. This suggests that while combining different DL approaches may seem promising, careful consideration must be given to the specific implementation and potential interactions between architectures. Further research is needed to optimize HDL architectures for BTS and other brain tumor imaging tasks.

Both papers emphasize the role of AI in improving diagnostic accuracy. However, the 2024 paper emphasizes the ability of AI in the extraction of novel imaging features that are not visible to the human eye, transforming radiological image analysis from a qualitative interpretation to an objective, quantifiable, and reproducible task (M. Cè, 2023). Future work needs to focus on prospective clinical trials that evaluate the impact of AI-assisted diagnosis on patient outcomes. More studies that focus on the clinical integration and validation are needed to translate the promises of AI into tangible improvements in patient care.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, both "Role of Artificial Intelligence in Brain Tumour Imaging" and "An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review" provide valuable insights into the application of AI in brain tumor imaging. While the first offers a broad perspective on the diverse applications of AI, the second delves into the critical issue of AI bias in brain tumor segmentation, thereby highlighting the importance of addressing bias in AI models to ensure reliable and equitable clinical application. The combined insights from these papers suggest a future where AI plays an increasingly integral role in brain tumor management. However, it is crucial to acknowledge and address the challenges related to data quality, standardization, and AI bias to fully realize the potential of AI in improving patient outcomes (Y. Yang, 2021). Future research should prioritize clinical validation, bias mitigation, and the optimization of AI architectures to ensure that AI-driven tools are safe, effective, and equitable for all patients.
