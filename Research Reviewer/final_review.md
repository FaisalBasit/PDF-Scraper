## A Comparative Review of AI Applications in Brain Tumor Imaging

**Introduction**

Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is rapidly transforming medical imaging, offering new possibilities for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of diseases. Brain tumors, with their complex morphology and heterogeneity, present a significant challenge in radiology. This review compares and contrasts two recent papers that explore the application of AI in brain tumor imaging. The first paper, "Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging" by Chukwujindu et al. (2024), provides a broad overview of AI applications in this field. The second paper, "An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review" by Das et al. (2022), focuses specifically on brain tumor segmentation (BTS) and the risk of bias associated with different AI architectures. Both papers acknowledge the transformative potential of AI while also highlighting challenges and limitations.

**Comparison of Methodologies and Scope**

Chukwujindu et al. (2024) present a comprehensive review of existing literature, synthesizing findings on various AI applications in brain tumor imaging. Their work encompasses lesion detection, differential diagnosis, anatomic segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and pseudo-progression evaluation. The review considers both glioma and non-glioma brain tumors and explores the use of transformer-based networks. This broad scope provides a general understanding of how AI-assisted tools can improve the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors.

In contrast, Das et al. (2022) adopt a more focused and systematic approach. Their narrative review employs the PRISMA methodology to select and analyze 75 relevant studies from PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The authors categorize DL studies into four classes based on their architecture: convolutional neural network (CNN)-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures. A key aspect of their methodology is the risk-of-bias (RoB) analysis, which assesses 32 AI attributes to identify potential sources of bias in brain lesion segmentation (BLS). This rigorous approach provides a detailed understanding of the performance and limitations of different DL architectures in BTS.

**Comparison of Key Findings and Results**

Chukwujindu et al. (2024) highlight the potential of AI to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. They note that computer-aided detection (CAD) tools can enhance the detection of small metastatic brain lesions, enabling earlier and more accurate treatment (G.S. Tandel et al., 2020). Furthermore, they emphasize the role of AI in transforming radiological image analysis from qualitative interpretation to an objective, quantifiable task through the extraction of imaging features. The paper also points out the promising results achieved with transformers in brain tumor imaging (M. Zhu, 2022). According to Chukwujindu et al. (2024), AI offers a pathway toward personalized medicine and better patient outcomes.

Das et al. (2022) offer a more nuanced perspective on the performance of different DL architectures in BTS. Their analysis reveals that transfer learning (TL) and encoder-decoder (ED) models generally outperform CNN-based and hybrid DL (HDL) architectures. Specifically, they found that ED-based models exhibit the lowest AI bias for BLS. The study provides both primary and secondary recommendations for minimizing the risk of bias in AI-driven brain tumor segmentation. Das et al. (2022) underscore the efficiency of DL in BTS due to its capacity for automatic feature extraction, acknowledging the need for careful consideration of potential biases when deploying AI in clinical settings.

**Contradictions, Gaps, and Future Research Implications**

While both papers agree on the potential of AI in brain tumor imaging, they differ in their emphasis. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) adopt a more optimistic view, highlighting the benefits of AI in various aspects of brain tumor management. Das et al. (2022), while acknowledging the advantages of DL, place greater emphasis on the potential biases and limitations. This difference in perspective is not necessarily a contradiction but rather a reflection of the different scopes and methodologies employed.

One potential gap identified in both papers is the limited discussion of the clinical validation of AI-driven tools. While both reviews cite studies that demonstrate the technical feasibility of AI in brain tumor imaging, there is a need for more research on the impact of these tools on actual patient outcomes. Future research should focus on conducting prospective clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of AI-assisted diagnostic and treatment planning systems. Studies could build upon the architectural findings of Das et al. (2022), exploring the implementation of TL and ED models, for example using architectures described by K. Kamnitsas et al. (2017), in prospective clinical settings.

Another important area for future research is the development of methods for mitigating bias in AI models. Das et al. (2022) provide valuable recommendations for reducing RoB, but more work is needed to develop robust and reliable bias detection and correction techniques. This is particularly important in the context of brain tumor imaging, where subtle differences in image quality or patient demographics can significantly impact the performance of AI models. Furthermore, as suggested by Chukwujindu et al. (2024), there needs to be more research on transformer networks and their applicability in brain tumor imaging.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, both Chukwujindu et al. (2024) and Das et al. (2022) provide valuable insights into the application of AI in brain tumor imaging. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) offer a broad overview of the field, highlighting the potential of AI to improve diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes. Das et al. (2022) provide a more focused analysis of brain tumor segmentation, emphasizing the importance of considering the risk of bias in AI models. While both papers acknowledge the challenges and limitations of AI, they ultimately agree on its transformative potential. Future research should focus on clinical validation, bias mitigation, and the exploration of new AI architectures to realize the full potential of AI in brain tumor imaging and strive towards the personalized medicine that Chukwujindu et al. (2024) envision. The work of A. Wadhwa et al. (2019) and others provide a good foundation for addressing issues of bias, but much work remains.
