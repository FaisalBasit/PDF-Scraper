## A Comparative Review of AI Applications in Brain Tumor Imaging and Segmentation

**Introduction**

The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine, particularly in the realm of neuro-oncology, is rapidly evolving. Brain tumors, with their diverse characteristics and complex management strategies, present a significant challenge for clinicians. AI offers the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy, treatment planning, and prognostication. This review comparatively analyzes two research papers that explore the role of AI in brain tumor imaging and segmentation: "Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging" (Chukwujindu et al., 2024) and "An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review" (Das et al., 2022). While both papers acknowledge the transformative potential of AI, they differ in their scope, methodology, and specific focus areas.

**Comparative Analysis of Methodologies and Scope**

Chukwujindu et al. (2024) present a broad overview of AI applications in brain tumor imaging. Their review encompasses lesion detection, differential diagnosis, anatomic segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and pseudo-progression evaluation. They also consider the use of AI in non-glioma brain tumors. The methodology employed is a survey of existing literature, focusing on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). In contrast, Das et al. (2022) narrow their focus to brain tumor *segmentation* (BTS) and conduct a risk-of-bias (RoB) analysis across different DL architectures. Using a PRISMA strategy, they analyze 75 relevant studies, categorizing them into CNN-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures. The goal is to provide recommendations for minimizing RoB in AI for BTS.

The difference in scope is evident: Chukwujindu et al. (2024) offer a holistic view of AI in neuro-oncology imaging, while Das et al. (2022) delve deeply into the specifics of BTS and the potential biases associated with different DL architectures. This difference in scope dictates the methodologies employed; Chukwujindu et al. (2024) synthesize a wide range of literature to provide a general overview, whereas Das et al. (2022) conduct a more structured meta-analysis to identify and quantify biases.

**Comparison of Findings and Conclusions**

Both papers highlight the potential of AI in improving brain tumor management. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) conclude that AI can enhance diagnostic accuracy, treatment planning, and personalized medicine. They note the ability of AI to improve the detection of small lesions using MRI, CT, and PET scan data, and emphasize the transformative potential of AI-driven feature extraction from radiological images. They specifically mention that CAD tools can improve diagnostic accuracy in detecting small metastatic brain lesions, allowing for early and accurate treatment planning, particularly for stereotactic radiosurgery. This aligns with the general trend of AI enhancing early detection and treatment strategies (Tandel et al., 2020).

Das et al. (2022) conclude that DL is an efficient AI technique for BTS due to its automatic feature extraction capabilities. Their analysis of different DL architectures reveals that transfer learning (TL) and encoder-decoder (ED) models generally outperform CNN and hybrid DL (HDL) models in terms of performance and bias. Specifically, ED-based models exhibited the lowest AI bias for BLS. They provide a set of primary and secondary recommendations for reducing RoB in AI for BTS. This focus on bias is critical, as unchecked biases can lead to inaccurate segmentation and, consequently, flawed treatment plans (Karimi et al., 2021).

A key difference lies in the specific recommendations. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) suggest that AI can improve diagnostic accuracy, especially in detecting small metastatic lesions (Grech et al., 2020), while Das et al. (2022) recommend specific architectural choices (ED-based models) and strategies to minimize bias in BTS.

**Contradictions, Gaps, and Future Research Implications**

While no direct contradictions exist between the two papers, their different focuses reveal gaps in the current understanding of AI in brain tumor management. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) provide a broad overview, but do not delve into the specific biases and limitations of different AI models. Das et al. (2022) address bias in BTS but do not cover the broader applications of AI in lesion detection, diagnosis, and prognostication.

Future research should focus on integrating these two perspectives. Studies are needed to evaluate the performance and biases of different AI models across a range of clinical applications, not just BTS. Furthermore, research should explore how to mitigate biases in AI models to ensure equitable and accurate diagnoses and treatment plans for all patients (Wadhwa et al., 2019). The use of transformer networks, as mentioned by Chukwujindu et al. (2024), warrants further investigation to determine their potential benefits and limitations in various neuro-oncological applications. Consideration should be given to how molecular markers (Wesseling et al., 2018) could further improve AI performance in brain tumor imaging.

**Synthesis and Conclusion**

In conclusion, both Chukwujindu et al. (2024) and Das et al. (2022) contribute valuable insights into the role of AI in brain tumor imaging and segmentation. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) provide a comprehensive overview of AI applications, highlighting its potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Das et al. (2022) offer a focused analysis of bias in BTS, emphasizing the importance of architectural choices and bias mitigation strategies. These papers complement each other, providing a more complete picture of the current state of AI in neuro-oncology. The future of AI in brain tumor management lies in integrating these perspectives, conducting rigorous evaluations of AI models, and developing strategies to minimize bias and ensure equitable and accurate outcomes for all patients. Further studies are needed to investigate the applications of AI in specific tumor types and to determine how AI can be used to personalize treatment plans based on individual patient characteristics. As AI technology continues to evolve, it has the potential to transform the field of neuro-oncology, leading to improved patient outcomes and a better understanding of brain tumors (Price, 2006).
