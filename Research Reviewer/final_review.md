## A Comparative Review of AI Applications and Bias in Brain Tumor Imaging

### Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming medical imaging, offering new possibilities for improved diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes. This review comparatively analyzes two research papers that address the role of AI in brain tumor imaging. The first paper, "Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging" by Chukwujindu et al. (2024), provides a broad overview of AI applications in this field. The second paper, "An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review" by Das et al. (2022), focuses specifically on brain lesion segmentation (BLS) and the critical issue of bias in AI models. By examining these two perspectives, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state and future directions of AI in brain tumor imaging.

### Methodologies and Focus

Chukwujindu et al. (2024) present a narrative review, synthesizing existing literature on AI techniques applied to brain tumor imaging. Their approach encompasses a wide range of applications, including lesion detection, differential diagnosis, anatomic segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and pseudo-progression evaluation, covering both glioma and non-glioma tumors. This broad scope allows for a holistic view of AI's potential in neuro-oncology.

In contrast, Das et al. (2022) adopt a more focused and systematic approach. Using the PRISMA methodology, they analyze 75 relevant studies to evaluate the effectiveness and bias of AI models for BLS. Their review categorizes deep learning (DL) studies based on architectural evolution, specifically CNN-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based models. Furthermore, they employ a quantitative analysis of AI attributes and bias assessment tools like AP(ai)Bias 1.0 to identify and rank studies based on their risk of bias (RoB). This rigorous methodology provides valuable insights into the factors contributing to bias in AI-driven BLS.

### Key Findings and Comparative Analysis

Both papers acknowledge the significant role of AI, particularly deep learning, in advancing brain tumor imaging. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) highlight the ability of AI to improve the diagnosis of small lesions using various imaging modalities, such as MRI, CT, and PET scans. They also emphasize the role of computer-aided detection (CAD) tools in enhancing diagnostic accuracy for detecting metastatic brain lesions. According to Chukwujindu et al. (2024), AI-driven feature extraction transforms radiological image analysis into an objective, quantifiable task, aligning with the shift toward precision medicine.

Das et al. (2022) delve deeper into the performance of different DL architectures for BLS. Their findings indicate that transfer learning (TL)-based models generally outperform other architectures, followed by encoder-decoder (ED)-based models. Notably, they identify ED-based models as having the lowest AI bias for BLS. This is a crucial observation, as it underscores the importance of architectural choices in mitigating bias and ensuring the reliability of AI models in clinical applications. The significance of segmentation and its challenges are highlighted by Price, S.J. (2006).

While both papers recognize the potential of AI, they diverge in their emphasis. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) primarily focus on showcasing the broad spectrum of AI applications and their benefits in various aspects of brain tumor imaging. Das et al. (2022), on the other hand, place a strong emphasis on the critical need to address and mitigate bias in AI models. They provide specific recommendations for lowering the RoB, thereby enhancing the trustworthiness and clinical utility of AI-based BLS. The challenges of data acquisition and annotation, leading to potential biases, are also implicitly acknowledged in both papers, with Das et al. (2022) providing a more explicit framework for addressing these issues.

Both reviews also touch upon the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in brain tumor imaging. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) mention the use of 3D U-Net CNNs for lesion detection in glioma patients using PET images, indicating the practical application of these models. Das et al. (2022) provide a comparative analysis of CNN-based models alongside other architectures, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in the context of bias and performance. Both papers implicitly acknowledge the importance of high-quality, labeled datasets for training effective CNN models.

### Contradictions, Gaps, and Future Research Implications

Despite the complementary nature of the two reviews, some subtle contradictions and gaps emerge. For example, while Chukwujindu et al. (2024) highlight the growing application of transformer-based networks in neuro-oncology imaging, Das et al. (2022) do not extensively cover these architectures in their analysis of BLS models. This could reflect the evolving landscape of AI in medical imaging, with transformer networks gaining prominence more recently.

Furthermore, both papers could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the ethical considerations surrounding AI in brain tumor imaging. Issues such as data privacy, algorithmic transparency, and the potential for biased outcomes warrant careful attention to ensure responsible and equitable implementation of AI technologies (Rowe, 2019). The challenges of translating AI models from research settings to clinical practice also represent a significant gap that needs to be addressed through future research and collaborative efforts between researchers, clinicians, and regulatory bodies (Grech et al., 2020).

Future research should focus on developing robust and generalizable AI models that can effectively handle the heterogeneity of brain tumors and patient populations. Addressing bias in AI algorithms is paramount, and efforts should be directed toward creating diverse and representative datasets, as well as developing bias-aware training techniques (Zhu, 2022). Additionally, exploring the integration of multi-modal imaging data and clinical information could lead to more comprehensive and personalized approaches to brain tumor diagnosis and treatment planning (Yang, 2021).

### Conclusion

In conclusion, both Chukwujindu et al. (2024) and Das et al. (2022) provide valuable insights into the role of AI in brain tumor imaging. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) offer a broad overview of AI applications, highlighting their potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Das et al. (2022) delve into the critical issue of bias in AI models for BLS, providing a framework for evaluating and mitigating RoB. By addressing bias and promoting the development of robust and generalizable AI algorithms, researchers can unlock the full potential of AI to transform brain tumor imaging and improve patient outcomes. The shift from qualitative to quantifiable image interpretation, as noted by Chukwujindu et al. (2024), represents a fundamental change in radiology, paving the way for more objective and data-driven clinical decision-making. As AI continues to evolve, ongoing research, ethical considerations, and collaborative efforts will be essential to ensure its responsible and effective implementation in brain tumor imaging and beyond (Tandel et al., 2020). The need for accurate segmentation is also emphasized by Kamnitsas et al. (2017).
