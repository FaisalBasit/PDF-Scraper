## A Comparative Review of AI Applications and Bias in Brain Tumor Imaging

### Introduction

The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medical imaging has witnessed exponential growth in recent years, particularly in the field of neuro-oncology. Brain tumors, characterized by their complex morphology and heterogeneous nature, pose significant challenges for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. AI-driven solutions, leveraging machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, offer promising avenues for enhanced lesion detection, segmentation, and prognostication. This review comparatively analyzes two research papers that address the role of AI in brain tumor imaging: "Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging" by Chukwujindu et al. (2024) and "An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review" by Das et al. (2022). While both papers acknowledge the transformative potential of AI in this domain, they differ in scope, methodology, and focus, providing complementary perspectives on the current state and future directions of AI in brain tumor imaging.

### Comparative Analysis of Methodologies and Scope

Chukwujindu et al. (2024) present a broad overview of AI applications in brain tumor imaging. Their work encompasses lesion detection, differential diagnosis, anatomic segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and pseudo-progression evaluation. They also explore the application of AI in non-glioma brain tumors, expanding the scope beyond the most common type of brain cancer. Their approach is primarily narrative, summarizing existing literature to illustrate the potential benefits and challenges of AI implementation in radiology. This broad approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of the different areas where AI can be applied, and it also discusses the development of CAD (computer-aided diagnosis) tools to improve diagnostic accuracy.

In contrast, Das et al. (2022) adopt a more focused and systematic approach. Their review specifically examines the application of deep learning (DL) to brain tumor segmentation (BTS) and incorporates a risk-of-bias (RoB) analysis. They categorize DL studies into CNN-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures, providing a structured framework for evaluating different model types. The systematic review adheres to PRISMA guidelines and includes a statistical analysis of AI attributes, adding a layer of rigor to their findings. The depth of their RoB analysis, utilizing 32 AI attributes and a ranking score method (RSM), provides valuable insights into the potential limitations of existing AI models.

Both papers acknowledge the critical role of MRI as a primary imaging modality for brain tumor diagnosis, owing to its superior soft tissue contrast (Price, 2006). However, their emphasis differs. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) highlight various AI applications across different tumor types and diagnostic tasks, while Das et al. (2022) concentrate on the technical aspects of DL models and their inherent biases in the context of segmentation.

### Comparison of Findings and Conclusions

Chukwujindu et al. (2024) conclude that AI has the potential to significantly improve the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors, leading to personalized medicine and better patient outcomes. They highlight the potential of AI to assist in complex tasks such as differentiating between pseudo-progression and true progression, which can be challenging for radiologists (Rowe, 2019). Furthermore, they mention the increasing use of transformer networks in neuro-oncology imaging, emphasizing the adaptability of AI to improve diagnostic precision.

Das et al. (2022) find that transfer learning (TL) and encoder-decoder (ED)-based models demonstrate superior performance for brain lesion segmentation with the lowest AI bias. Their RoB analysis reveals potential limitations in existing studies and provides recommendations for lowering bias, such as improving data quality and standardization. While Chukwujindu et al. (2024) briefly mention the challenges of data quality, Das et al. (2022) delve deeper into the issue, emphasizing the need for robust methodologies to ensure the reliability of AI-driven segmentation. They show that biases can be quantified and addressed to improve the validity of AI applications in neuro-oncology.

### Contradictions, Gaps, and Future Research Implications

While both papers advocate for the use of AI in brain tumor imaging, there are subtle differences in their perspectives. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) present a more optimistic view of AI's potential, focusing on its diverse applications and benefits. Das et al. (2022), while acknowledging the promise of AI, emphasize the importance of addressing biases and methodological limitations. This contrast is not necessarily a contradiction but rather a reflection of the different lenses through which they examine the topic.

One notable gap is the limited discussion of specific AI tools and platforms in Das et al. (2022), which primarily focuses on theoretical frameworks. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) touch upon the development of CAD tools, indicating a more practical orientation. Future research could bridge this gap by evaluating the performance and biases of specific AI tools in real-world clinical settings.

Both papers imply a need for improved data quality and standardization. The lack of standardized datasets and annotation protocols remains a significant obstacle to the widespread adoption of AI in brain tumor imaging (Tandel et al., 2020). Future research should focus on developing and validating standardized datasets that can be used to train and evaluate AI models. Another area for future exploration is the explainability of AI models. As AI becomes more integrated into clinical decision-making, it is crucial to understand how these models arrive at their conclusions (Yang, 2021). Explainable AI (XAI) techniques can help to build trust in AI systems and facilitate their adoption by clinicians.

### Synthesis and Conclusion

In conclusion, both Chukwujindu et al. (2024) and Das et al. (2022) contribute valuable insights into the application of AI in brain tumor imaging. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) provide a broad overview of the diverse applications of AI, highlighting its potential to improve diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes. Das et al. (2022) offer a more focused analysis of deep learning-based segmentation, emphasizing the importance of addressing biases and methodological limitations. By combining these perspectives, a more nuanced understanding of the current state and future directions of AI in brain tumor imaging emerges. The field must address the challenges of data quality, standardization, and bias to fully realize the potential of AI in improving the care of patients with brain tumors. The convergence of technological advancements, rigorous validation, and ethical considerations will pave the way for AI-driven solutions that are not only accurate but also reliable and equitable. Further investigation into non-glioma tumors, as mentioned by Chukwujindu et al. (2024), would also be a valuable area of research considering the concentration of existing literature around gliomas, which is indirectly highlighted by Das et al. (2022).
