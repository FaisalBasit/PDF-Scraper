## A Comparative Review of AI Applications in Brain Tumor Imaging and Segmentation

Brain tumors represent a significant global health challenge, necessitating advancements in diagnostic and treatment strategies. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), has emerged as a promising tool in neuro-oncology. This review comparatively analyzes two research papers that investigate the role of AI in brain tumor imaging and segmentation: "Role of Artificial Intelligence in Brain Tumour Imaging" by Chukwujindu et al. (2024) and "An Artificial Intelligence Framework and Its Bias for Brain Tumor Segmentation: A Narrative Review" by Das et al. (2022). While both papers acknowledge the transformative potential of AI in this field, they differ in their scope, methodology, and specific focus areas.

Chukwujindu et al. (2024) provide a broad overview of AI applications in brain tumor imaging, encompassing lesion detection, differential diagnosis, anatomical segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and pseudo-progression evaluation. Their work also extends to AI applications in non-glioma brain tumors and identifies the challenges and limitations of AI implementation in radiology. In contrast, Das et al. (2022) narrow their focus to brain lesion segmentation (BLS) and the critical issue of bias in AI models. Their narrative review aims to link the risk of bias (RoB) with different AI architectural clusters in popular DL frameworks. Both papers underscore the importance of AI in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning; however, their approaches to investigating this potential vary considerably.

The methodologies employed by the two studies reflect their differing objectives. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) adopt a review methodology, synthesizing findings from existing literature. This approach allows them to provide a comprehensive snapshot of the current state of AI in neuro-oncology imaging, covering a wide range of applications and tumor types. They highlight the advancements in transformer-based neural networks, showcasing the evolving landscape of AI in medical imaging. Das et al. (2022), on the other hand, utilize a systematic review approach based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. They selected 75 relevant studies and categorized them into four classes based on their architectural underpinnings: convolutional neural network (CNN)-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures. Their analysis considers 32 AI attributes and computes a composite score to assess bias, offering a more granular and technically focused perspective. This rigorous methodology allows Das et al. to provide specific recommendations for minimizing bias in AI models for BLS.

The key findings of the two studies align in their recognition of AI's potential but diverge in their emphasis. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) emphasize the clinical applications of AI, highlighting its capacity to improve diagnostic accuracy, facilitate early treatment planning, and transform radiological image analysis into an objective and quantifiable task. They suggest that AI can pave the way for personalized medicine and improved patient outcomes. Das et al. (2022) delve deeper into the technical aspects of AI models, finding that transfer learning (TL) and encoder-decoder (ED) models generally outperform CNN and hybrid DL models in brain lesion segmentation. Notably, they found that ED-based models exhibited the lowest AI bias. Their study culminates in a set of primary and secondary recommendations designed to mitigate the risk of bias in AI for BLS, contributing practical guidance for researchers and practitioners in the field.

Several similarities and differences emerge upon comparing the two papers. Both acknowledge the pivotal role of AI, particularly deep learning, in revolutionizing brain tumor imaging and segmentation. They concur on the potential of AI to enhance diagnostic accuracy and improve treatment planning. Both studies also recognize the existing challenges in AI implementation, such as data quality, standardization, and the need for robust and generalizable models. However, their differences lie in their specific focus and methodological rigor. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) offer a broad, clinically oriented overview, while Das et al. (2022) provide a technically detailed, bias-aware analysis of brain lesion segmentation models.

Despite their valuable contributions, both studies have limitations and implications for future research. Chukwujindu et al. (2024), while comprehensive, do not delve deeply into the technical nuances of specific AI architectures or the potential biases inherent in these models. Das et al. (2022) provide an extensive bias analysis but primarily focus on segmentation, potentially overlooking other critical aspects of brain tumor imaging, such as diagnosis and prognostication, which Aneja et al. (2019) highlighted as key application areas. Future research could benefit from integrating the broad clinical perspective of Chukwujindu et al. (2024) with the rigorous bias assessment methodology of Das et al. (2022). Furthermore, exploring the application of transformer-based neural networks (mentioned by Chukwujindu et al., 2024) in addressing the biases identified by Das et al. (2022) could be a promising avenue for investigation. The need for high-quality, well-annotated, and diverse datasets, as emphasized by both studies, remains a critical challenge. Addressing this data scarcity and heterogeneity is essential for developing AI models that are both accurate and unbiased. Yang (2021) comparative analysis of neural network architectures further underscores the importance of selecting appropriate models for specific tasks and datasets.

In conclusion, both Chukwujindu et al. (2024) and Das et al. (2022) provide valuable insights into the evolving role of AI in brain tumor imaging and segmentation. While Chukwujindu et al. (2024) offer a broad clinical perspective, Das et al. (2022) provide a technically detailed analysis of bias in segmentation models. By synthesizing the findings of both studies, it becomes clear that AI holds immense potential for improving the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors, but this potential must be realized with careful attention to data quality, model selection, and bias mitigation. Future research should focus on integrating these considerations to develop robust, generalizable, and equitable AI solutions for neuro-oncology. The use of AI-driven extraction of imaging features, as mentioned by Chukwujindu et al. (2024), can transform radiological image analysis into a quantifiable task, moving away from qualitative interpretations. Addressing the limitations and building upon the strengths of existing research will pave the way for personalized medicine and better patient outcomes in the fight against brain tumors.
