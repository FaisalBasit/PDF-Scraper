## A Comparative Review of AI Applications in Brain Tumor Imaging

### Introduction

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medical imaging has shown immense promise, particularly in the field of brain tumor diagnosis and treatment. This review comparatively analyzes two research papers that explore different facets of this burgeoning field. The first paper, "Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging" by Chukwujindu et al. (2024), offers a broad overview of AI applications across various aspects of brain tumor imaging. The second paper, "An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review" by Das et al. (2022), focuses specifically on brain tumor segmentation (BTS) using deep learning, with a critical assessment of potential biases inherent in these models. Both papers acknowledge the transformative potential of AI, especially machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), in enhancing diagnostic accuracy, treatment planning, and ultimately, patient outcomes.

### Methodological and Scope Comparison

Chukwujindu et al. (2024) adopt a review approach, synthesizing existing literature to illustrate the diverse applications of AI in brain tumor imaging. Their work encompasses lesion detection, differential diagnosis, segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and even extends to non-glioma tumors and the use of transformer networks. This broad scope provides a comprehensive snapshot of the field. In contrast, Das et al. (2022) narrow their focus to brain tumor segmentation, employing a narrative review methodology that adheres to the PRISMA strategy, incorporating 75 studies. They categorize DL studies based on AI architectures, including CNN-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based models, and further perform a risk of bias (RoB) analysis using 32 AI attributes and a ranking score method (RSM). This methodological rigor allows for a more granular understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different AI approaches in BTS.

### Key Findings and Contrasting Perspectives

Chukwujindu et al. (2024) conclude that AI holds significant potential to improve the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors, advocating for the development of computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) tools to enhance diagnostic accuracy. They highlight various AI applications, stating that AI can assist in lesion detection, differential diagnosis, and pseudo-progression evaluation. The authors suggest that AI can pave the way for personalized medicine and better patient outcomes. They point to the promising potential of transformer networks in this domain.

Das et al. (2022) also highlight the efficiency of DL in BTS, but critically emphasize the importance of addressing biases in AI models to ensure reliability and clinical applicability. Their analysis reveals that TL models tend to outperform other architectures, followed by ED, CNN, and HDL. Notably, ED-based models were found to exhibit the lowest AI bias for BLS. They provide specific primary and secondary recommendations for mitigating RoB, thereby contributing actionable insights for researchers and practitioners. Both papers highlight the importance of pre-processing and overfitting considerations to maximize the performance of AI models, a shared theme underscoring fundamental best practices in the field.

The key difference lies in the depth of analysis regarding bias. While Chukwujindu et al. (2024) broadly discuss AI applications, Das et al. (2022) delve into the nuances of AI bias, offering a quantitative assessment of different DL architectures and their associated biases. This focus is a critical contribution, considering the potential for biased AI models to perpetuate or even exacerbate existing healthcare disparities. Furthermore, Das et al. (2022) incorporate a formal risk of bias assessment, a methodological element absent in Chukwujindu et al. (2024), which lends greater weight to their conclusions regarding the reliability of different AI approaches.

### Overlapping Themes and Future Research Implications

Both studies converge on the understanding that AI, especially DL, can revolutionize brain tumor imaging. They both underscore the necessity of accurate and reliable methods for brain tumor diagnosis and treatment planning. However, the differing scopes and methodologies illuminate several avenues for future research.

The broad overview provided by Chukwujindu et al. (2024) suggests a need for more targeted research into specific AI applications, such as the use of transformer networks in brain tumor imaging. Given the promising potential of transformers, further studies could explore their efficacy in various tasks, including segmentation, classification, and prediction of treatment response. Moreover, their inclusion of non-glioma tumors highlights the potential for AI to improve diagnosis and treatment across a wider spectrum of brain tumors. Works such as G.S. Tandel et al. (Jul. 2020) and Y. Yang (Dec. 2021) which are cited, are examples of works exploring the utility of AI in medical imaging.

The bias analysis conducted by Das et al. (2022) underscores the crucial need for developing strategies to mitigate bias in AI models. Their recommendations for reducing RoB provide a valuable starting point for future research. Further studies could investigate the effectiveness of these recommendations in real-world clinical settings. Moreover, research is needed to explore the ethical implications of using AI in brain tumor imaging and to develop guidelines for responsible AI development and deployment. In the paper by Das et al. (2022), the works of A. Wadhwa et al. (Sep 2019) and H.-H. Chang et al. (2008) likely helped to build the basis of the study.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, both Chukwujindu et al. (2024) and Das et al. (2022) contribute valuable insights into the role of AI in brain tumor imaging. While Chukwujindu et al. (2024) provide a comprehensive overview of AI applications, Das et al. (2022) offer a more focused analysis of brain tumor segmentation and the potential for bias in AI models. The contrasting perspectives and methodological approaches complement each other, highlighting both the promise and the challenges of integrating AI into clinical practice. As AI continues to evolve, future research should prioritize addressing the ethical considerations and biases inherent in these models to ensure equitable and reliable healthcare for all patients. The development of robust, unbiased AI tools for brain tumor imaging has the potential to transform diagnosis, treatment planning, and ultimately, patient outcomes.
