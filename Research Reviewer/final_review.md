## A Comparative Review of AI Applications in Brain Tumor Imaging and Segmentation

**Introduction**

The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized numerous fields, and medical imaging is no exception. In the context of brain tumor diagnosis and management, AI techniques offer the potential to enhance accuracy, efficiency, and personalization. This review comparatively analyzes two research papers focusing on AI applications in brain tumor imaging and segmentation. The first paper, "Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging" (Chukwujindu et al., 2024), provides a broad overview of AI's role in neuro-oncology, encompassing various applications. The second paper, "An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review" (Das et al., 2022), narrows its focus to brain tumor segmentation (BTS), specifically examining the risk of bias in different AI architectures. By comparing these papers, we aim to synthesize their findings, identify research gaps, and discuss future implications.

**Comparison of Findings and Methodologies**

Chukwujindu et al. (2024) adopt a broad perspective, surveying the landscape of AI applications in brain tumor imaging. Their review encompasses lesion detection, differential diagnosis, anatomic segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and pseudo-progression evaluation, including non-glioma brain tumors. The paper synthesizes information from numerous studies, highlighting the potential of AI to improve the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors, leading to personalized medicine and better patient outcomes. They suggest AI can enhance the detection of small lesions and improve radiological image analysis, aligning with the broader goal of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools as mentioned by Tandel et al. (2020) who used AI paradigm for MRI brain tumor classification.

In contrast, Das et al. (2022) concentrate specifically on brain tumor segmentation (BTS) and employ a systematic review methodology based on PRISMA guidelines, analyzing 75 relevant studies. They categorized DL studies into four architectural classes: convolutional neural network (CNN)-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based. Their analysis focuses on identifying and quantifying the risk of bias (RoB) associated with each architecture, considering 32 AI attributes. This focus allows for a more in-depth evaluation of the technical aspects of AI models used for segmentation. Their key finding is that transfer learning (TL) models perform the best, followed by encoder-decoder (ED) models, with ED-based models exhibiting the lowest AI bias for BLS. This insight is crucial for guiding the development of more reliable and robust AI-based segmentation tools.

Both papers acknowledge the significance of AI in medical imaging but differ in their methodological approaches. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) offer a comprehensive, narrative review, while Das et al. (2022) present a systematic, quantitative analysis. The differing scopes reflect the distinct objectives of each study, with the former aiming to provide a broad overview and the latter focusing on a specific application and its associated biases.

**Contradictions, Gaps, and Future Research Implications**

While the papers do not present direct contradictions, their different focuses reveal certain gaps in the current research landscape. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) highlight the potential of AI in various aspects of brain tumor management, but they also acknowledge the challenges and limitations of AI implementation in radiology. The paper touches on several key applications, such as the extraction of imaging features for radiological image analysis, as supported by Zhu (2022), but it does not delve deeply into the specific technical challenges associated with each application.

Das et al. (2022) address one of these challenges by focusing on the risk of bias in BTS models. Their findings suggest that certain architectures are more prone to bias than others, underscoring the importance of careful model selection and validation. This leads to implications for future research and to explore how to mitigate biases and optimize segmentation performance. The study opens questions about how transfer learning can be further leveraged to improve segmentation accuracy and reduce bias. Given the conclusions of Das et al. (2022) which highlighted the performance of transfer learning models, Karimi et al. (2021) offers interesting insights on this topic.

Further research should focus on validating AI models on diverse datasets to ensure generalizability and robustness. The papers also highlight the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between clinicians, radiologists, and AI experts to develop and implement AI-based solutions effectively. As noted by Rowe (2019) in their introduction to machine learning for clinicians, the importance of such collaboration cannot be overstated.

**Synthesis and Conclusion**

In synthesis, both Chukwujindu et al. (2024) and Das et al. (2022) contribute valuable insights into the application of AI in brain tumor imaging. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) paint a broad picture of AI's potential across various neuro-oncology domains, whereas Das et al. (2022) delve into the specifics of brain tumor segmentation, shedding light on the critical issue of bias in AI models.

The convergence of these findings underscores the transformative potential of AI in brain tumor diagnosis and treatment. AI promises to improve diagnostic accuracy, enhance treatment planning, and personalize patient care. However, it also emphasizes the need for careful model selection, rigorous validation, and interdisciplinary collaboration. By addressing the challenges and gaps identified in these reviews, the field can move towards realizing the full potential of AI in improving outcomes for patients with brain tumors. Future research should focus on developing more robust and generalizable AI models, validating these models on diverse datasets, and promoting collaboration between clinicians, radiologists, and AI experts. Only through such concerted efforts can we ensure that AI is used responsibly and effectively to improve the lives of patients with brain tumors.
