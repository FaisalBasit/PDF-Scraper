## A Comparative Review of AI Applications in Brain Tumor Imaging: Broad Applications vs. Segmentation Bias

**Introduction**

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming medical imaging, offering unprecedented opportunities for enhanced diagnosis, treatment planning, and personalized medicine. Brain tumor imaging, in particular, has witnessed significant advancements through the application of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. This review comparatively analyzes two research papers that investigate the role of AI in this domain. The first paper, "Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging" by Chukwujindu et al. (2024), provides a broad overview of AI applications across various aspects of brain tumor imaging, including lesion detection, diagnosis, segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and treatment evaluation. The second paper, "An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review" by Das et al. (2022), focuses specifically on AI frameworks for brain tumor segmentation (BTS), analyzing different DL architectures and assessing the risk of bias in these models. This review will compare and contrast the objectives, methodologies, findings, and conclusions of these two papers, highlighting their individual contributions and identifying potential gaps and future research directions.

**Comparison of Methodologies and Scope**

Chukwujindu et al. (2024) adopt a broad literature review approach to explore the multifaceted applications of AI in brain tumor imaging. Their work encompasses both glioma and non-glioma evaluations, covering a wide range of AI-assisted tools used in diagnosis and treatment. The review discusses various ML and DL techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), and their applications in lesion detection, grading, segmentation, and prognostication. This broad scope provides a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape of AI in brain tumor imaging.

In contrast, Das et al. (2022) employ a more focused and systematic approach, concentrating specifically on brain tumor segmentation and the associated risk of bias. Their research methodology involves a PRISMA-guided systematic literature review of 75 relevant studies. They categorize DL studies into four architectural classes: CNN-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures. The authors analyze these architectures based on 32 AI attributes, including imaging modalities, hyperparameters, and performance evaluation metrics, using a ranking score method (RSM) and AP(ai)Bias 1.0 to assess the risk of bias. This rigorous methodology allows for a detailed statistical analysis of bias within different DL models used for BTS.

The difference in scope and methodology reflects the distinct objectives of the two papers. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) aim to provide a general overview of AI's potential in brain tumor imaging, while Das et al. (2022) seek to critically evaluate the performance and bias of specific DL architectures used for brain tumor segmentation.

**Comparison of Findings and Conclusions**

Chukwujindu et al. (2024) highlight several key findings regarding the application of AI in brain tumor imaging. They note that AI can improve the diagnosis of small lesions using MRI, CT, and PET scan data, and that AI-driven extraction of imaging features can transform radiological image analysis. They also emphasize the promising role of transformer networks in neuro-oncology imaging. The authors conclude that AI has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy, enable early treatment planning, and transform radiological image analysis into a more objective and quantifiable task, ultimately paving the way for personalized medicine.

Das et al. (2022) focus on the performance and bias of different DL architectures for BTS. Their key findings indicate that the four classes of architectures rank in performance from best to worst as follows: TL > ED > CNN > HDL. They also found that ED-based models exhibited the lowest AI bias for BLS. Based on their analysis, the authors provide primary and secondary recommendations for lowering the risk of bias in AI models for brain tumor segmentation. They conclude that DL is an efficient AI technique in BTS due to its automatic feature extraction capabilities, and that a statistical depth analysis of different architectures is crucial for understanding and mitigating bias.

Both studies acknowledge the importance of MRI in brain tumor imaging.

**Contradictions, Gaps, and Future Research Implications**

While the two papers do not present direct contradictions, their different scopes and focuses reveal certain gaps and areas for future research. For example, Chukwujindu et al. (2024) broadly mention the potential of AI in non-glioma brain tumors, while Das et al. (2022) do not explicitly address this aspect in their segmentation-focused review. Further research could explore the specific challenges and opportunities of applying AI-based segmentation techniques to non-glioma tumors, considering the unique characteristics of these lesions.

Furthermore, Das et al. (2022) highlight the importance of addressing bias in AI models for BTS, a topic that is not explicitly covered by Chukwujindu et al. (2024). This suggests a need for more research on the ethical implications and potential biases of AI applications in broader aspects of brain tumor imaging beyond segmentation. Future studies could investigate how biases in training data or model design might affect the accuracy and fairness of AI-driven diagnostic tools, prognostic models, and treatment planning systems.

The emphasis on transformer networks by Chukwujindu et al. (2024) also points to an area for further investigation. While transformer networks show promise, their performance and robustness in real-world clinical settings need to be thoroughly evaluated. Future research should compare the performance of transformer-based models with other DL architectures, such as CNNs and ED-based models, in various brain tumor imaging tasks, considering factors such as data availability, computational resources, and clinical interpretability. Studies like those from G.S. Tandel et al. (Jul. 2020) and Y. Yang (Dec. 2021) could provide benchmark data to extend this research.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, both Chukwujindu et al. (2024) and Das et al. (2022) provide valuable insights into the application of AI in brain tumor imaging. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) offer a broad overview of the diverse roles AI can play in improving diagnosis, treatment planning, and personalized medicine, mentioning the importance of tools discussed by L.F. Machado et al. (Sep. 2020) and the classification methods mentioned by P. Wesseling et al. (Feb. 2018). Das et al. (2022), on the other hand, provide a focused analysis of brain tumor segmentation, highlighting the importance of addressing bias in DL models, building upon earlier work like that of A. Wadhwa et al. (Sep 2019) and H.-H. Chang et al. (2008). While Chukwujindu et al. (2024) emphasize the potential of AI to transform radiological image analysis into a more objective and quantifiable task, Das et al. (2022) caution against the uncritical adoption of AI, stressing the need for rigorous bias assessment and mitigation strategies. Together, these papers underscore the transformative potential of AI in brain tumor imaging while also highlighting the importance of addressing the ethical and methodological challenges associated with its implementation. Future research should focus on bridging the gaps between these two perspectives, exploring the specific applications of AI in different types of brain tumors, addressing the risk of bias in broader AI-driven tasks beyond segmentation, and rigorously evaluating the performance and robustness of emerging AI architectures in real-world clinical settings.
