## A Comparative Review of AI Applications in Brain Tumor Imaging and Segmentation

**Introduction**

The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging has witnessed exponential growth in recent years, particularly in the realm of brain tumor diagnosis and management. Two recent review papers, "Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging" by Chukwujindu et al. (2024) and "An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review" by Das et al. (2022), offer distinct yet complementary perspectives on this rapidly evolving field. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) provide a broad overview of AI techniques, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), across various applications in brain tumor imaging, ranging from lesion detection to prognostication. Conversely, Das et al. (2022) delve specifically into brain tumor segmentation (BTS) using DL, emphasizing the critical issue of bias in AI models and its impact on segmentation accuracy. This review aims to synthesize the key findings, methodologies, and conclusions of both papers, highlighting their similarities, differences, and potential implications for future research and clinical practice.

**Comparison of Findings and Methodologies**

Both Chukwujindu et al. (2024) and Das et al. (2022) underscore the transformative potential of AI in brain tumor imaging. Both reviews recognize the pivotal role of ML and DL algorithms in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. They concur that AI-driven approaches can improve the detection of subtle lesions, potentially leading to earlier and more effective interventions. Both works implicitly acknowledge the importance of various imaging modalities such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in AI-assisted brain tumor analysis.

However, the scope and focus of the two papers diverge considerably. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) present a wide-ranging survey of AI applications, encompassing lesion detection, differential diagnosis, anatomic segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and pseudo-progression evaluation. They discuss how computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools can improve diagnostic accuracy in detecting small metastatic brain lesions, enabling prompt treatment planning. The review also highlights the potential of AI-driven extraction of imaging features to revolutionize radiological image analysis and mentions the promising role of Transformers in neuro-oncology imaging.

In contrast, Das et al. (2022) adopt a more specialized approach, concentrating specifically on brain tumor segmentation (BTS) using DL techniques. Their review categorizes DL architectures into four main types: CNN-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures. The authors then analyze the performance of these architectures, finding that TL models generally outperform other categories, followed by ED-based models. A key contribution of Das et al. (2022) is their emphasis on the risk of bias (RoB) in AI models for BTS. They analyze the influence of 32 AI attributes and offer concrete recommendations for mitigating RoB, thereby improving the reliability and generalizability of BTS algorithms. Their methodological approach involves a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines, analyzing 75 relevant studies to assess architectural evolution and AI attributes, in line with similar studies assessing biases (Wadhwa et al., 2019).

The methodologies employed by the two papers also differ. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) present a general review of existing literature, synthesizing findings from a variety of studies. Das et al. (2022), on the other hand, employ a more structured approach, using the PRISMA strategy to systematically analyze and categorize studies based on DL architecture and AI attributes. This structured approach allows Das et al. (2022) to conduct a more in-depth comparative analysis of different DL techniques and their associated biases, demonstrating how different DL architectures like CNNs (Kamnitsas et al., 2017) and ED-based models (Soltaninejad, 2018) impact segmentation performance and bias.

**Discussion of Contradictions, Gaps, and Future Research Implications**

While both papers acknowledge the potential of AI, they implicitly highlight different limitations and challenges. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) touch on the challenges associated with data quality, standardization, and integration, which are crucial for the successful implementation of AI in clinical practice. The authors also point out the need for further research to validate the performance of AI algorithms in diverse patient populations and clinical settings.

Das et al. (2022) specifically address the issue of bias in AI models, which can significantly impact their accuracy and fairness. The authors emphasize the importance of carefully considering potential sources of bias when developing and evaluating AI algorithms for BTS. Their finding that ED-based models exhibit lower AI bias suggests that architectural choices can play a crucial role in mitigating bias (Bonte et al., 2018). However, this also opens up the opportunity to investigate hybrid methodologies.

One potential gap in both papers is a detailed discussion of the ethical considerations surrounding the use of AI in brain tumor imaging. As AI algorithms become more sophisticated, it is essential to address issues such as data privacy, algorithmic transparency, and accountability. Future research should focus on developing ethical frameworks for the responsible development and deployment of AI in this field.

Furthermore, there is a need for more prospective studies to evaluate the clinical impact of AI-based tools for brain tumor imaging. While both papers cite numerous studies demonstrating the technical feasibility of AI algorithms, there is limited evidence on how these tools translate into improved patient outcomes. Future research should focus on conducting randomized controlled trials to assess the impact of AI on diagnostic accuracy, treatment planning, and patient survival, similar to what has been studied in other areas of medical imaging (Tandel et al., 2020).

The development of more robust and generalizable AI algorithms remains a key challenge. Current AI models often perform well on the datasets they were trained on but struggle to generalize to new datasets or patient populations. Future research should focus on developing techniques such as transfer learning (Yang, 2021) and domain adaptation to improve the generalizability of AI models.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, both Chukwujindu et al. (2024) and Das et al. (2022) provide valuable insights into the application of AI in brain tumor imaging and segmentation. While Chukwujindu et al. (2024) offer a broad overview of AI techniques across various applications, Das et al. (2022) focus specifically on brain tumor segmentation and the critical issue of bias in AI models. Both papers highlight the transformative potential of AI in improving diagnosis and treatment planning, but also acknowledge the challenges and limitations that need to be addressed. Future research should focus on developing more robust, generalizable, and ethical AI algorithms, as well as conducting prospective studies to evaluate their clinical impact. By addressing these challenges, AI can pave the way for personalized medicine and improved outcomes for patients with brain tumors.
