## A Comparative Review of AI Applications in Brain Tumor Imaging: Scope, Methodologies, and Future Directions

**Introduction**

The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging has witnessed exponential growth, particularly in the domain of brain tumor imaging. This review comparatively analyzes two recent research papers that explore the role of AI in this critical area. The first paper, "Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging" by Chukwujindu et al. (2024), provides a broad overview of AI applications across various aspects of brain tumor imaging. The second, "An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review" by Das et al. (2022), delves specifically into brain tumor segmentation (BTS) using deep learning (DL) and analyzes potential biases within AI models. Both papers underscore the transformative potential of AI in improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning for brain tumors, but they differ in scope, methodology, and focus.

**Comparative Analysis of Findings and Methodologies**

Chukwujindu et al. (2024) present a comprehensive review of how AI, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), can be leveraged in brain tumor imaging. Their work spans lesion detection, differential diagnosis, anatomic segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and pseudo-progression evaluation. The review also considers AI applications in non-glioma brain tumors, highlighting the versatility of AI across different tumor types. The authors emphasize AI's ability to transform radiological image analysis into an objective, quantifiable, and reproducible process, which traditionally relied on qualitative interpretations. The use of MRI, CT, and PET data in lesion detection is specifically mentioned. Their methodology involves surveying existing literature and using ChatGPT to analyze and retrieve results from the reviewed articles.

In contrast, Das et al. (2022) concentrate primarily on the application of DL for BTS and the associated risk-of-bias (RoB). Their systematic review, guided by the PRISMA strategy, analyzes 75 relevant studies extracted from PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The authors categorize DL-based segmentation models into CNN-based, encoder-decoder-based, transfer learning-based, and hybrid DL-based architectures. Through a rigorous RoB analysis using 32 AI attributes and a ranking score method (RSM), they assess bias in each study. Their findings indicate that transfer learning (TL)-based architectures generally exhibit superior performance, followed by encoder-decoder (ED)-based models, while ED-based models showed the lowest AI bias for BLS.

A key difference lies in the methodologies employed. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) present a general overview, synthesizing findings from diverse studies to illustrate the broad applicability of AI. Das et al. (2022), on the other hand, adopt a systematic approach, quantifying and categorizing bias within specific DL architectures used for BTS. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) also mentions the use of transformer networks, an architectural detail not explicitly covered by Das et al. (2022).

**Overlapping Themes and Divergences**

Both papers recognize the significant potential of AI, particularly deep learning, to revolutionize brain tumor imaging. They concur on the importance of accurate and reliable brain tumor segmentation for improved diagnosis and treatment planning. Both acknowledge that AI techniques can be applied to analyze various medical imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, and PET.

However, their scopes diverge considerably. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) offer a wider perspective, encompassing lesion detection, differential diagnosis, prognostication, and non-glioma tumors. Das et al. (2022) maintain a laser focus on BTS, meticulously examining the technical nuances of AI models and identifying sources of bias.

The different foci lead to distinct conclusions. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) conclude that AI has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy, facilitate early treatment planning, and transform radiological image analysis. In alignment, Das et al. (2022) highlight DL's efficiency in BTS due to its automatic feature extraction capabilities and provide specific recommendations for reducing bias and enhancing the reliability of AI-based BTS.

**Contradictions, Gaps, and Future Research Implications**

While the two papers do not present direct contradictions, their differing focuses reveal gaps in the current understanding and application of AI in brain tumor imaging. For example, while Das et al. (2022) delve deeply into the biases present in segmentation models, Chukwujindu et al. (2024) touch on the practical implications of AI in a broader clinical context, like the ability to detect small metastatic brain lesions and improve diagnostic accuracy in challenging cases.

Future research should aim to bridge these gaps. Studies could explore the clinical impact of the biases identified by Das et al. (2022) on patient outcomes and treatment decisions. Further work is needed to validate the findings of both reviews in prospective clinical trials. Considering the rise of transformer networks in medical imaging, future studies could evaluate their performance and potential biases in BTS, building upon the work of both Chukwujindu et al. (2024) and Das et al. (2022). Furthermore, investigations into the ethical considerations surrounding AI implementation in brain tumor imaging, including data privacy and algorithmic transparency, are crucial.

**Synthesis and Conclusion**

In conclusion, both Chukwujindu et al. (2024) and Das et al. (2022) provide valuable insights into the application of AI in brain tumor imaging. Chukwujindu et al. (2024) paint a broad picture of AI's potential, emphasizing its ability to enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning across a range of applications. Das et al. (2022) offer a more granular perspective, focusing on the technical aspects of DL-based BTS and the critical need to address bias in AI models. The papers collectively highlight the transformative potential of AI in this field while underscoring the importance of rigorous validation, bias mitigation, and ethical considerations. Future research should strive to integrate these perspectives to realize the full potential of AI in improving outcomes for patients with brain tumors, potentially moving toward personalized medicine (Chukwujindu et al., 2024). The ongoing evolution of AI architectures and methodologies, such as transformer networks, warrants continuous evaluation and refinement to ensure reliable and equitable application in clinical practice.
