**Combined Overview:**

Both papers address the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in brain tumor imaging and segmentation. The first paper, "Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging" (Chukwujindu et al., 2024), provides a broad overview of AI techniques, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), for various tasks such as lesion detection, differential diagnosis, segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and pseudo-progression evaluation, covering both glioma and non-glioma tumors. It also discusses the challenges and limitations of AI implementation. The second paper, "An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review" (Das et al., 2022), focuses specifically on brain tumor segmentation (BTS) using DL techniques. It categorizes DL approaches into CNN-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures. This paper emphasizes the risk of bias (RoB) in AI models and provides recommendations for lowering RoB in BTS.

**Paper 1: Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging (Chukwujindu et al., 2024)**

*   **Abstract and Main Objectives:** The paper reviews how AI can assist in brain tumor imaging, focusing on ML and DL techniques. It aims to cover AI applications in lesion detection, differential diagnosis, anatomic segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and pseudo-progression evaluation, including non-glioma brain tumors.

*   **Research Methodologies:** The paper is a review article, surveying existing literature on AI applications in brain tumor imaging. It discusses various AI techniques and their applications based on previously published studies.

*   **Key Findings and Results:** AI can improve the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors. CAD tools can improve diagnostic accuracy in detecting small metastatic brain lesions, allowing for early and accurate treatment planning. AI-driven extraction of imaging features is transforming radiological image analysis. Transformers show promise in neuro-oncology imaging.

*   **Conclusions:** AI has the potential to improve the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors, paving the way for personalized medicine and better patient outcomes. The development of CAD tools can improve diagnostic accuracy in detecting small metastatic brain lesions.

**Paper 2: An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review (Das et al., 2022)**

*   **Abstract and Main Objectives:** The paper reviews AI-based models for brain lesion segmentation (BLS), focusing on the link between the risk of bias (RoB) in AI and its architectures. It categorizes DL studies based on architectural evolution and analyzes them considering AI attributes.

*   **Research Methodologies:** The study uses a PRISMA strategy, analyzing 75 relevant studies. DL studies are categorized into CNN-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures. The studies are then analyzed considering 32 AI attributes.

*   **Key Findings and Results:** The four classes of architectures, from best-to worst-performing, are TL > ED > CNN > HDL. ED-based models had the lowest AI bias for BLS. The study presents recommendations for lowering RoB.

*   **Conclusions:** DL is an efficient AI technique in BTS due to its automatic feature extraction. The study reviews articles that employed four different DL architectural models and performed a statistical depth analysis.

**Differences:**

*   Chukwujindu et al. (2024) provides a broader overview of AI applications, including lesion detection, diagnosis, and prognostication, covering both glioma and non-glioma tumors, while Das et al. (2022) focuses specifically on brain tumor segmentation (BTS).
*   Das et al. (2022) emphasizes the risk of bias (RoB) in AI models and provides recommendations for lowering RoB, whereas Chukwujindu et al. (2024) touches on challenges more generally (data quality, standardization, integration).
*   Das et al. (2022) categorizes DL approaches into CNN-based, ED-based, TL-based, and HDL-based architectures and compares their performance, while Chukwujindu et al. (2024) does not provide such a detailed architectural comparison.
*   Chukwujindu et al. (2024) discusses the potential of Transformers in neuro-oncology, which is not a focus of Das et al. (2022).
*   The methodologies differ, with Das et al (2022) employing a specific PRISMA strategy and bias analysis.
