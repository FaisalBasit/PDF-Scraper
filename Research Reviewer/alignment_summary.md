# Alignment of AI in Brain Tumor Imaging Research Papers

This document aligns two research papers focusing on the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in brain tumor imaging:

1.  **Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging** by Chukwujindu, E., Faiz, H., AI-Douri, S., Faiz, K., & De Sequeira, A. (2024). European Journal of Radiology, 176, 111509.
2.  **An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review** by Das, S., Nayak, G.K., Saba, L., Kalra, M., Suri, J.S., & Saxena, S. (2022). Computers in Biology and Medicine, 105273.

## Combined Overview

Both papers address the growing role of AI, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), in brain tumor imaging. They highlight the potential of AI to improve diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes. However, they approach the topic from slightly different angles. The Chukwujindu et al. (2024) paper provides a broad overview of AI applications across various aspects of brain tumor imaging, including lesion detection, differential diagnosis, segmentation, molecular marker identification, and prognostication, while also touching on non-glioma tumors and transformer networks. The Das et al. (2022) paper focuses specifically on brain tumor segmentation (BTS) using deep learning, analyzing different AI architectures and assessing the risk of bias in these models.

| **Key Differences**     | Chukwujindu et al. offers a broader overview, while Das et al. focuses specifically on segmentation and bias. Chukwujindu et al. considers non-glioma tumors and transformer networks, whereas Das et al. does not specifically focus on these.                           | Das et al. provides a quantitative analysis of different DL architectures and their associated biases, which is not present in Chukwujindu et al. Das et al. employs a risk of bias assessment, a specific methodological element absent in Chukwujindu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
