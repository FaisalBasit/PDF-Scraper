### Combined Overview of Both Papers

*   **Paper 1:** "Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging" (Chukwujindu et al., 2024)

    *   **Abstract and Main Objectives:** This review discusses how AI can assist in brain tumor imaging, focusing on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. It covers AI applications in lesion detection, differential diagnosis, anatomic segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and pseudo-progression evaluation. It also covers AI applications in non-glioma brain tumours and highlights the challenges and limitations of AI implementation in radiology. The paper aims to evaluate various uses of AI-assisted tools in the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors, focusing on brain gliomas, non-glioma evaluations, and transformer-based networks in brain tumor imaging.
    *   **Research Methodologies:** The paper is a review that synthesizes existing literature on AI applications in brain tumor imaging. It examines studies using ML and DL techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs).
    *   **Key Findings and Results:** AI can improve the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors, aiding in early and accurate treatment planning, particularly for stereotactic radiosurgery. AI-driven extraction of imaging features is transforming radiological image analysis. The development of CAD tools can improve diagnostic accuracy in detecting small metastatic brain lesions.
    *   **Conclusions:** AI has the potential to improve the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors, providing a path towards personalized medicine and better patient outcomes.
    *   **Focus Areas:** Gliomas, non-glioma tumors, transformer networks, lesion detection, segmentation, diagnosis, prognostication.
*   **Paper 2:** "An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review" (Das et al., 2022)

    *   **Abstract and Main Objectives:** This review focuses on linking the risk-of-bias (RoB) in AI with different AI-based architectural clusters in popular DL frameworks for brain lesion segmentation (BLS). It aims to present a narrative review considering all facets of BLS due to variance in designs and input data types in medical imaging.
    *   **Research Methodologies:** A PRISMA strategy was used to analyze 75 relevant studies. DL studies were categorized into convolutional neural network (CNN)-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures. These studies were analyzed considering 32 AI attributes, and a composite score was computed, normalized, and ranked to detect low-, moderate-, and high-bias studies.
    *   **Key Findings and Results:** Transfer learning (TL) models performed best, followed by encoder-decoder (ED), CNN, and hybrid DL (HDL) models. ED-based models had the lowest AI bias for BLS.
    *   **Conclusions:** The study presents recommendations for lowering the RoB in AI for BTS.
    *   **Focus Areas:** Brain lesion segmentation, deep learning architectures (CNN, ED, TL, HDL), risk-of-bias analysis, PRISMA methodology.

### Similarities and Differences

*   **Similarities:**
    *   Both papers emphasize the role of AI, particularly deep learning, in brain tumor imaging.
    *   Both papers acknowledge the importance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in brain tumor image analysis.

*   **Differences:**
    *   **Focus:** Chukwujindu et al. (2024) provide a broad overview of AI applications in brain tumor imaging, including lesion detection, diagnosis, and prognostication, with a focus on gliomas, non-gliomas, and transformer networks. Das et al. (2022) specifically focus on brain tumor segmentation (BTS) and the risk-of-bias (RoB) associated with different deep learning architectures.
    *   **Methodology:** Chukwujindu et al. (2024) conduct a general literature review. Das et al. (2022) use a structured PRISMA approach to analyze and categorize studies based on AI architecture and bias.
    *   **Scope:** Chukwujindu et al. (2024) cover a wider range of AI applications in neuro-oncology. Das et al. (2022) concentrate specifically on segmentation and architectural bias.
    *   **Emphasis:** Chukwujindu et al. (2024) highlight the potential of AI for personalized medicine. Das et al. (2022) emphasize the need to address and mitigate bias in AI models for reliable brain tumor segmentation.
    *   **Specific Architectures:** While both discuss CNNs, Das et al. (2022) delve into encoder-decoder (ED), transfer learning (TL), and hybrid DL (HDL) architectures, providing a comparative performance analysis.
    *   **Transformers:** Chukwujindu et al. (2024) mention the promise of transformers in neuro-oncology imaging, Das et al. (2022) do not focus on transformers.
