**Combined Overview:**
Both papers review the application of AI in brain tumor imaging. The first paper ("Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging") provides a broad overview of AI techniques (ML, DL, Transformers) for various tasks like lesion detection, diagnosis, and prognostication, covering both glioma and non-glioma tumors. The second paper ("An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review") focuses specifically on brain tumor segmentation (BTS) using deep learning, categorizing architectures (CNN, ED, TL, HDL) and analyzing risk-of-bias in these models.

**Similarities:**
*   Both papers recognize the increasing importance of AI, particularly deep learning, in brain tumor imaging.
*   Both acknowledge the potential of AI to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning.
*   Both papers are literature reviews, synthesizing findings from multiple studies.
*   Both papers acknowledge the importance of MRI as a key imaging modality.
*   Both papers discuss the importance of accurate and fast brain tumor segmentation.

**Differences:**
*   **Scope:** The first paper has a broader scope, covering various AI applications in brain tumor imaging, while the second focuses specifically on segmentation and bias analysis.
*   **Focus:** The first paper discusses transformer networks; the second does not. The second paper emphasizes the risk-of-bias in AI models, which is not a primary focus of the first paper.  The first paper also covers non-glioma evaluations.
*   **Methodology:** The first paper is a general review. The second uses a structured PRISMA approach and quantitative bias analysis, including 32 AI attributes for risk assessment.
*   **Architectural Classification:** The second paper provides a detailed classification of deep learning architectures for segmentation (CNN, ED, TL, HDL) and compares their performance, finding TL > ED > CNN > HDL, with ED-based models having the lowest AI bias. The first paper provides a more general overview of ML and DL techniques.
*   **Emphasis:** The first paper emphasizes the potential for personalized medicine. The second emphasizes reducing risk of bias.
