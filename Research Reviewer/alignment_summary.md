### Combined Analysis of Two Research Papers on AI in Brain Tumor Imaging and Segmentation
#### Overview
The two papers under review both address the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of brain tumor imaging and segmentation. The first paper, "Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging" (Chukwujindu et al., 2024), provides a broad overview of how AI, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), can assist in various aspects of brain tumor imaging, including lesion detection, differential diagnosis, segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and pseudo-progression evaluation. It also touches on non-glioma brain tumors and the challenges of AI implementation. The second paper, "An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review" (Das et al., 2022), focuses specifically on brain tumor segmentation (BTS) using AI, with a particular emphasis on deep learning architectures and the risk of bias (RoB) associated with these models. It categorizes DL studies into CNN-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures and analyzes them based on various AI attributes.
#### Similarities
*   **Focus on AI in Brain Tumor Imaging:** Both papers recognize the increasing importance of AI, especially ML and DL, in improving the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors.
*   **Emphasis on Deep Learning:** Both papers highlight the significant role of deep learning techniques in medical image analysis, particularly for brain tumor segmentation.
