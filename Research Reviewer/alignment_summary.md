    *   Review article, summarizing existing literature on AI applications in brain tumor imaging.
    *   Focus on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques.
    *   Discussion of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Vision Transformers (ViT).

*   **Key Findings and Results:**

    *   AI can improve the diagnosis of small lesions using MRI, CT, and PET scan data.
    *   AI-driven extraction of imaging features can transform radiological image analysis.
    *   CAD tools can improve diagnostic accuracy in detecting small metastatic brain lesions.

*   **Conclusions:**

    *   AI has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning for brain tumors.
    *   AI can transform radiological image analysis into a more objective and quantifiable task.

**Paper 2: An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review**

*   **Abstract and Main Objectives:**

    *   **Abstract:** Examines the use of AI in brain tumor segmentation (BTS), focusing on the risk-of-bias (RoB) in AI architectures. Categorizes DL studies into CNN-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures. Analyzes these studies considering 32 AI attributes and computes a composite score to detect low-, moderate- and high-bias studies.
    *   **Main Objectives:**
        *   Present a systematic review on BLS using the latest AI technology.
        *   Discuss a detailed statistical analysis of BLS in DL technology
        *   Classify the DL-based segmentation model into four different categories (CNN-based, ED-based, TL-based, HDL-based).
        *   Perform a depth-wise bias analysis of these models for a BLS task.

*   **Research Methodologies:**

    *   Systematic review using the PRISMA strategy, based on 75 relevant studies.
    *   Categorization of DL studies into four classes: CNN-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures.
    *   Analysis considering 32 AI attributes.
    *   Risk-of-bias (RoB) analysis using a ranking score method (RSM).

*   **Key Findings and Results:**

    *   The four classes of architectures, from best-to worst-performing, are TL > ED > CNN > HDL.
    *   ED-based models had the lowest AI bias for BLS.
    *   Presents three primary and six secondary recommendations for lowering the RoB.

*   **Conclusions:**

    *   DL is the most recent efficient AI technique in BTS due to its automatic feature extraction.
    *   A statistical depth analysis was carried out, and results were displayed as pie charts and bar charts showing the distributions of different parameters.
