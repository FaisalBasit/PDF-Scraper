## Combined Analysis of Two Research Papers on AI in Brain Tumor Imaging

### Paper 1: Role of Artificial Intelligence in Brain Tumour Imaging (European Journal of Radiology, 2024)

*   **Abstract and Main Objectives:** This review discusses the role of AI in brain tumor imaging, focusing on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. It describes how AI can assist in lesion detection, differential diagnosis, anatomic segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and pseudo-progression evaluation. The paper also covers AI applications in non-glioma brain tumors and highlights the challenges and limitations of AI implementation in radiology. The overall objective is to evaluate the various uses of AI-assisted tools in the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors.

*   **Research Methodologies:** The paper is a review article that synthesizes findings from existing literature on AI in brain tumor imaging. It covers ML and DL techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs). The review includes discussion of AI applications in glioma and non-glioma tumors.

*   **Key Findings and Results:**
    *   AI can improve the diagnosis of small lesions using MRI, CT, and PET scan data.
    *   AI-driven extraction of imaging features can transform radiological image analysis.
    *   Transformers show promise in neuro-oncology imaging for diagnosis, classification, and treatment.
    *   CAD tools can improve diagnostic accuracy in detecting small metastatic brain lesions.

*   **Conclusions:** AI has the potential to improve the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors, paving the way for personalized medicine and better patient outcomes. The development of CAD tools can improve diagnostic accuracy in detecting small metastatic brain lesions, allowing for early and accurate treatment planning, particularly for stereotactic radiosurgery. AI-driven extraction of imaging features that are not visible to the human eye is transforming radiological image analysis and reporting from a qualitative interpretation to an objective, quantifiable, and reproducible task.

### Paper 2: An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review (Computers in Biology and Medicine, 2022)

*   **Abstract and Main Objectives:** This review focuses on linking the risk-of-bias (RoB) in AI with different AI-based architectural clusters in popular DL frameworks for brain lesion segmentation (BLS). It categorizes DL studies into four classes: convolutional neural network (CNN)-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures. The objective is to present a narrative review considering all facets of BLS and to provide recommendations for lowering RoB.

*   **Research Methodologies:** The study uses a PRISMA strategy based on 75 relevant studies. DL studies were categorized into four classes based on architectural evolution: CNN-based, ED-based, TL-based, and HDL-based. These studies were then analyzed considering 32 AI attributes, with clusters including AI architecture, imaging modalities, hyper-parameters, performance evaluation metrics, and clinical evaluation. A ranking score method (RSM) was used to estimate RoB.

*   **Key Findings and Results:**
    *   The four classes of architectures, from best-to worst-performing, are TL > ED > CNN > HDL.
    *   ED-based models had the lowest AI bias for BLS.
    *   The study presents a set of three primary and six secondary recommendations for lowering the RoB.

*   **Conclusions:** DL is an efficient AI technique in BTS due to its automatic feature extraction. The review analyzed articles that employed four different DL architectural models (CNN-based, ED-based, TL-based, and HDL-based). Statistical depth analysis was performed and results were displayed.
