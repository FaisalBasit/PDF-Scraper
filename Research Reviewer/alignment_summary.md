### Combined Overview of Brain Tumor Imaging Research with AI

This document consolidates findings from two research papers focusing on the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in brain tumor imaging. The first paper, "An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review" by Das et al. (2022), provides a systematic review of AI-based deep learning (DL) techniques for brain tumor segmentation (BTS), emphasizing risk-of-bias (RoB) analysis. The second paper, "Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging" by Chukwujindu et al. (2024), discusses how AI can assist in various aspects of brain tumor imaging, including lesion detection, differential diagnosis, segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and pseudo-progression evaluation, also covering non-glioma brain tumors and transformer-based networks.

### Paper 1: An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review (Das et al., 2022)

*   **Abstract and Main Objectives:**
    *   Examines the effectiveness of AI-based models in brain lesion segmentation (BLS).
    *   Links the risk-of-bias (RoB) in AI with different AI architectures.
    *   Categorizes DL studies into CNN-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures.
    *   Analyzes these studies based on 32 AI attributes.
    *   Establishes a bias cutoff to detect low-, moderate-, and high-bias studies.

*   **Research Methodologies:**
    *   PRISMA strategy using 75 relevant studies from PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar.
    *   Categorization of DL studies into four classes based on architectural evolution: CNN, ED, TL, and HDL.
    *   Analysis based on 32 AI attributes, including AI architecture, imaging modalities, hyper-parameters, performance evaluation metrics, and clinical evaluation.
    *   Ranking Score Method for Risk-of-bias (RoB) estimation.
    *   Composite score computation, normalization, and ranking to determine bias.

*   **Key Findings and Results:**
    *   The performance of the four classes of architectures ranked from best to worst: TL > ED > CNN > HDL.
    *   ED-based models had the lowest AI bias for BLS.
    *   Presents primary and secondary recommendations for lowering the RoB.

*   **Conclusions:**
    *   DL is an efficient AI technique in BTS due to its automatic feature extraction.
    *   Statistical depth analysis was carried out on the four different DL architectural models (CNN-based, ED-based, TL-based, and HDL-based).

    *   Covers AI applications in non-glioma brain tumors.
    *   Highlights challenges and limitations of AI implementation in radiology.

*   **Research Methodologies:**
    *   Review of existing literature on AI applications in brain tumor imaging.
    *   Discussion of ML and DL techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT).
    *   Examination of AI's role in various aspects of brain tumor management, from diagnosis to treatment planning.

*   **Key Findings and Results:**
    *   AI improves the diagnosis of small lesions using MRI, CT, and PET scan data.
    *   AI-driven extraction of imaging features transforms radiological image analysis.
    *   Transformers show promise in neuro-oncology imaging for diagnosis, classification, and treatment.
