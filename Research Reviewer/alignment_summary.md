*   **Combined Overview:**

    *   Both papers address the application of AI in brain tumor imaging. The first paper provides a broad overview of AI's role in various aspects of brain tumor imaging, including detection, diagnosis, and treatment planning, encompassing both Glioma and non-Glioma tumors. The second paper delves deeper into the specifics of AI frameworks for brain tumor segmentation (BTS), focusing on deep learning (DL) architectures and the risk of bias (RoB) associated with them, primarily concerning Gliomas.
*   **Similarities:**

    *   Both papers recognize the potential of AI to improve brain tumor diagnosis and treatment.
    *   Both highlight the importance of DL techniques in medical image analysis, particularly MRI, CT and PET scans.
    *   Both identify challenges related to data quality, standardization, and integration in AI implementation.
*   **Differences:**

    *   The first paper covers a broader range of AI applications (lesion detection, differential diagnosis, prognostication, etc.) in both Glioma and non-Glioma tumors, while the second paper concentrates specifically on brain tumor segmentation of Gliomas and associated AI bias.
    *   The first paper offers a general discussion of AI techniques including machine learning and deep learning, while the second paper provides a more in-depth analysis of DL architectures (CNN, ED, TL, HDL) and their associated biases in segmentation.
    *   The first paper also highlights the use of Transformer based networks which the second paper does not.
    *   The second paper employs a more structured methodology (PRISMA, RoB analysis) compared to the first paper's narrative review approach.
