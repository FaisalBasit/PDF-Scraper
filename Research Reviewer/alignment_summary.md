**Paper 1:**

*   **Title:** Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging
*   **Authors:** Ezekiel Chukwujindu, Hafsa Faiz, Sara AI-Douri, Khunsa Faiz, Alexandra De Sequeira
*   **Journal:** European Journal of Radiology
*   **Volume:** 176, July 2024, 111509
*   **DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2024.111509](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2024.111509)

    *   **Abstract:** This review discusses how AI can assist in brain tumor imaging, focusing on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. It describes AI applications in lesion detection, differential diagnosis, anatomic segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and pseudo-progression evaluation. It covers AI applications in non-glioma brain tumors and highlights the challenges and limitations of AI implementation in radiology, such as data quality, standardization, and integration. The conclusion is that AI can potentially improve the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors, providing a path towards personalized medicine and better patient outcomes.
    *   **Introduction/Objectives:** The paper aims to evaluate the various uses of AI-assisted tools in the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors, with a focus on brain gliomas as well as non-glioma evaluations, and transformer-based networks in brain tumor imaging. It addresses the increasing need for non-invasive, automatic computer-aided tools for quick tumor diagnosis and grading due to the rising incidence of brain tumors.
    *   **Methodologies:** The paper is a review that discusses existing literature on AI applications (ML and DL) in brain tumor imaging. It covers various AI techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs).
    *   **Key Findings and Results:** AI can improve the diagnosis of small lesions using MRI, CT, and PET scan data. AI-driven extraction of imaging features is transforming radiological image analysis. The development of CAD tools can improve diagnostic accuracy in detecting small metastatic brain lesions, allowing for early and accurate treatment planning. Transformer networks show promise.
    *   **Conclusions:** AI has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy, treatment planning, and personalized medicine in brain tumor management.
    *   **Challenges:** The review highlights challenges including the need for high-quality data, seamless workflow integration, and generalizability of AI methods across diverse settings and population groups.

**Paper 2:**

*   **Title:** An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review
*   **Authors:** Suchismita Das, G.K. Nayak, Luca Saba, Mannudeep Kalra, Jasjit S. Suri, Sanjay Saxena
*   **Journal:** Computers in Biology and Medicine
*   **DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2022.105273](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2022.105273)
    *   **Abstract:** This review focuses on linking risk-of-bias (RoB) in AI with different AI-based architectural clusters in popular DL frameworks for brain lesion segmentation (BLS). It categorizes DL studies into CNN-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures. These studies were analyzed considering 32 AI attributes, and a composite score was computed, normalized, and ranked. A bias cutoff was established to detect low-, moderate- and high-bias studies.
    *   **Introduction/Objectives:** The paper aims to present a systematic review of BLS using the latest AI technology, focusing on deep learning. It seeks to classify DL-based segmentation models into four categories (CNN-based, ED-based, TL-based, HDL-based) and perform a depth-wise bias analysis of these models for a BLS task.
    *   **Methodologies:** The study uses a PRISMA strategy based on 75 relevant studies found by searching PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. DL studies were categorized into four classes based on architectural evolution: CNN-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures.
    *   **Key Findings and Results:** The study found that the four classes of architectures, from best-to worst-performing, are TL > ED > CNN > HDL. ED-based models had the lowest AI bias for BLS.
    *   **Conclusions:** DL is the most recent efficient AI technique in BTS due to its automatic feature extraction.
    *   **Risk of Bias and Recommendations:** The study presents a set of three primary and six secondary recommendations for lowering the RoB. It employs an AP(ai)Bias 1.0, which is based on a ranking score method (RSM).

### Alignment of Information

**Similarities:**

*   Both papers emphasize the role of AI, particularly deep learning, in brain tumor imaging.
*   Both papers acknowledge the importance of AI in improving the accuracy and efficiency of brain tumor diagnosis and treatment.
*   Both papers discuss the use of different AI architectures like CNNs.
*   Both are review papers summarizing and synthesizing existing research.
*   Both papers identify challenges related to data quality and model validation.

**Differences:**

*   **Focus:** Paper 1 provides a broad overview of AI applications in brain tumor imaging, including lesion detection, diagnosis, segmentation, and prognostication, with a specific mention of non-glioma tumors and transformer networks. Paper 2 concentrates specifically on brain lesion segmentation (BLS) and performs a risk-of-bias analysis of different DL architectures.
*   **Methodology:** Paper 1 is a general review. Paper 2 uses a structured PRISMA approach to select and analyze studies, categorizing them by DL architecture and assessing bias.
*   **Bias Analysis:** Paper 2 uniquely focuses on and presents a detailed risk-of-bias analysis (RoB) of AI models for BLS, which is not a primary focus of Paper 1.
*   **Architectural Categorization:** Paper 2 categorizes DL architectures into CNN-based, ED-based, TL-based, and HDL-based, and ranks their performance and bias. Paper 1 does not provide such a detailed architectural comparison.
