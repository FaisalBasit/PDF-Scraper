### Combined Analysis of Two Research Papers on AI in Brain Tumor Imaging

**Paper 1: Role of Artificial Intelligence in Brain Tumour Imaging (European Journal of Radiology)**

*   **Abstract:** This review discusses the application of AI, specifically machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), in brain tumor imaging. It covers lesion detection, differential diagnosis, anatomic segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and pseudo-progression evaluation. It also explores AI applications in non-glioma brain tumors. The review highlights challenges like data quality and standardization and concludes that AI can improve brain tumor diagnosis and treatment, leading to personalized medicine.

*   **Introduction/Objectives:** To evaluate the uses of AI-assisted tools in the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors, focusing on gliomas and non-glioma evaluations, and transformer-based networks. The paper emphasizes the need for non-invasive diagnostic tools given the limitations of biopsies and the increasing incidence of brain tumors.

*   **Methodologies:** The paper is a review article, surveying existing literature on the application of AI (ML and DL) in brain tumor imaging. It discusses various AI techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs).

*   **Key Findings and Results:** AI can improve the diagnosis of small lesions using MRI, CT, and PET scan data. AI-driven extraction of imaging features can transform radiological image analysis. Transformers show promise in neuro-oncology imaging.

*   **Conclusions:** AI has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy, treatment planning, and personalized medicine in brain tumor management. CAD tools improve detection of metastatic brain lesions.

**Paper 2: An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review (Computers in Biology and Medicine)**

*   **Abstract:** This review examines the use of AI in brain tumor segmentation (BTS), focusing on the risk of bias (RoB) in AI architectures. It categorizes DL studies into CNN-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures. The study analyzes these architectures considering AI attributes, and a bias cutoff is established to detect low-, moderate-, and high-bias studies.

*   **Introduction/Objectives:** To present a systematic review of BLS using the latest AI technology, specifically deep learning. It aims to classify DL-based segmentation models into four categories (CNN, ED, TL, HDL) and perform a bias analysis of these models. A key objective is to connect AI technologies with the tumor imaging paradigm

*   **Methodologies:** A PRISMA strategy was used to select 75 relevant studies from PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. DL studies were categorized into four classes based on architectural evolution (CNN, ED, TL, HDL). A ranking score method (RSM) was used to evaluate bias based on 32 AI attributes.

*   **Key Findings and Results:** The four classes of architectures, from best to worst performing, are TL > ED > CNN > HDL. ED-based models had the lowest AI bias for BLS. The study proposes primary and secondary recommendations for lowering RoB.

*   **Conclusions:** DL is an efficient AI technique in BTS. The review analyzes four DL architectural models. A statistical depth analysis was carried out.

### Alignment: Similarities and Differences

**Similarities:**

*   **Focus on AI in Brain Tumor Imaging:** Both papers address the application of artificial intelligence in the context of brain tumor imaging.
*   **Emphasis on Deep Learning:** Both papers highlight the significance of deep learning techniques for image analysis and segmentation.
*   **Recognition of Challenges:** Both acknowledge the challenges associated with implementing AI in radiology, including data quality and the need for robust and generalizable models.
*   **Segmentation as a Key Application:** Both papers consider brain tumor segmentation as a critical application area.

**Differences:**

*   **Scope:** Paper 1 has a broader scope, covering lesion detection, diagnosis, prognostication, and applications in various tumor types (gliomas and non-gliomas). Paper 2 focuses specifically on brain tumor *segmentation* and the risk of bias in AI models used for this purpose.
*   **Methodology:** Paper 1 is a general review, while Paper 2 uses a systematic review methodology (PRISMA) and performs a quantitative bias analysis.
*   **Bias Analysis:** Paper 2 uniquely focuses on analyzing and quantifying the risk of bias in different AI architectures. Paper 1 acknowledges the importance of data quality and generalizability but doesn't perform a specific bias analysis.
