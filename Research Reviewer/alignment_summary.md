### Combined Analysis of Two Research Papers on AI in Brain Tumor Imaging

#### Paper 1: Role of Artificial Intelligence in Brain Tumour Imaging (European Journal of Radiology)

*   **Abstract and Main Objectives:** This review discusses how AI can assist in brain tumor imaging, focusing on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. It explores AI's role in lesion detection, differential diagnosis, anatomic segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and pseudo-progression evaluation. It also covers AI applications in non-glioma brain tumors and highlights the challenges and limitations of AI implementation in radiology. The conclusion posits that AI can potentially improve the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors and provide a path towards personalized medicine and better patient outcomes.

*   **Research Methodologies:** The paper is a review article that synthesizes existing literature on the application of AI in brain tumor imaging. It examines studies employing ML and DL techniques in various aspects of tumor diagnosis and treatment.

*   **Key Findings and Results:** AI can improve the diagnosis of small lesions, aid in early and accurate treatment planning, and transform radiological image analysis from qualitative to objective and quantifiable tasks. The review highlights applications in glioma and non-glioma tumors and touches on transformer-based networks.

*   **Conclusions:** AI has the potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, treatment planning, and personalized medicine in the context of brain tumors. CAD tools and AI-driven feature extraction are key advancements.

#### Paper 2: An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review

*   **Abstract and Main Objectives:** This review focuses on linking risk-of-bias (RoB) in AI with different AI-based architectural clusters in popular DL frameworks for brain lesion segmentation (BLS). It categorizes DL studies based on architectural evolution into CNN-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures. It analyzes these studies considering 32 AI attributes and computes a composite score to detect low-, moderate-, and high-bias studies. The objective is to provide recommendations for lowering RoB.

*   **Research Methodologies:** A PRISMA strategy was used to select 75 relevant studies from PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The selected studies were analyzed based on 32 AI attributes, and a ranking score method (RSM) was employed to assess bias.

*   **Key Findings and Results:** The four classes of architectures, from best-to-worst performing, are TL > ED > CNN > HDL. ED-based models had the lowest AI bias for BLS. The study presents primary and secondary recommendations for lowering RoB.

*   **Conclusions:** DL is an efficient AI technique for BTS due to its automatic feature extraction. The review identifies different DL architectural models and carries out a statistical depth analysis, providing recommendations to improve the bias of the studies.

### Alignment of Information

#### Similarities

*   **Focus on AI in Brain Tumor Imaging:** Both papers focus on the application of artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning and deep learning, in brain tumor imaging.
*   **Emphasis on Deep Learning:** Both reviews acknowledge deep learning as a significant approach for brain tumor analysis.
*   **Segmentation as a Key Application:** Both papers identify segmentation as a crucial task where AI can provide significant benefits.
*   **Review Methodology:** Both are review papers, synthesizing existing research rather than presenting new experimental data.

#### Differences

*   **Scope:** The first paper provides a broader overview of AI applications in neuro-oncology, including lesion detection, diagnosis, and prognostication, covering both glioma and non-glioma tumors. The second paper specifically focuses on brain tumor segmentation (BTS) and analyzes the risk of bias in different DL architectures used for this task.
*   **Bias Analysis:** The second paper uniquely addresses the risk of bias in AI models, categorizing architectures (CNN, ED, TL, HDL) and assessing their performance and potential biases using a ranking score method. The first paper acknowledges challenges in AI implementation but does not delve into a detailed bias analysis.
*   **Architectural Focus:** The second paper provides a detailed classification and comparison of different deep learning architectures (CNN, Encoder-Decoder, Transfer Learning, Hybrid DL) used in brain tumor segmentation. The first paper generally mentions ML and DL techniques, including transformers, but doesn't provide an in-depth architectural analysis.
*   **PRISMA vs. Narrative Review:** The second paper explicitly uses a PRISMA strategy for literature selection, providing a more systematic approach. The first paper is a narrative review.
