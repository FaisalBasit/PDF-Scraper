## Combined Analysis of AI in Brain Tumor Imaging and Segmentation

This document combines insights from two research papers focusing on the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in brain tumor imaging and segmentation:

1.  **"Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging"** (Chukwujindu et al., 2024) published in *European Journal of Radiology*.
2.  **"An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review"** (Das et al., 2022) published in *Computers in Biology and Medicine*.

### Paper 1: Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging (Chukwujindu et al., 2024)

*   **Abstract and Main Objectives:** This review discusses how AI can assist in brain tumor imaging, focusing on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. It covers AI applications in lesion detection, differential diagnosis, anatomic segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and pseudo-progression evaluation. It also covers AI applications in non-glioma brain tumors. The paper highlights challenges and limitations of AI implementation in radiology and concludes that AI can potentially improve the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors.

*   **Research Methodologies:** The paper is a review article, surveying existing literature on AI applications in brain tumor imaging. It focuses on ML and DL techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs).

*   **Key Findings and Results:** AI can improve the diagnosis of small lesions using MRI, CT, and PET scan data. AI-driven extraction of imaging features can transform radiological image analysis. Transformer networks show promise.

*   **Conclusions:** AI has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy, treatment planning, and personalized medicine in brain tumor management. CAD tools can improve diagnostic accuracy in detecting small metastatic brain lesions, allowing for early and accurate treatment planning, particularly for stereotactic radiosurgery.

### Paper 2: An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review (Das et al., 2022)

*   **Abstract and Main Objectives:** This review focuses on linking risk-of-bias (RoB) in AI with different AI-based architectural clusters in popular DL frameworks for brain lesion segmentation (BLS). The study uses a PRISMA strategy to analyze relevant studies, categorizing them into CNN-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures. It aims to provide recommendations for lowering RoB in AI for BTS.

*   **Research Methodologies:** The study uses a PRISMA strategy based on 75 relevant studies. DL studies were categorized into four classes: CNN-based, ED-based, TL-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures. These studies were then analyzed considering 32 AI attributes. A bias cutoff was established to detect low-, moderate- and high-bias studies.

*   **Key Findings and Results:** The four classes of architectures, from best-to worst-performing, are TL > ED > CNN > HDL. ED-based models had the lowest AI bias for BLS. The study presents a set of three primary and six secondary recommendations for lowering the RoB.

*   **Conclusions:** DL is an efficient AI technique in BTS due to its automatic feature extraction. The study reviewed articles that employed four different DL architectural models. A statistical depth analysis was carried out.

### Similarities and Differences:

*   **Similarities:** Both papers acknowledge the increasing role and potential of AI, particularly ML and DL, in brain tumor imaging and analysis. They both highlight the use of techniques like CNNs. Both papers recognize the importance of medical imaging (MRI, CT) in the diagnosis and management of brain tumors.

*   **Differences:** The Chukwujindu et al. (2024) paper offers a broader overview of AI applications, including lesion detection, diagnosis, segmentation, and prognostication, and non-glioma tumors. It also briefly touches on the use of transformers. Das et al. (2022) focuses specifically on brain tumor *segmentation* (BTS) and performs a risk-of-bias analysis across different DL architectures (CNN, ED, TL, HDL). Das et al. (2022) provides a more in-depth analysis of the *architectural* aspects of DL models and their associated biases, whereas Chukwujindu et al. (2024) concentrates on the *clinical applications* of AI in neuro-oncology.
