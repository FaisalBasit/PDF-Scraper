## CrewAI: Get Started Introduction

### What is CrewAI?

CrewAI is a lean, lightning-fast Python framework built entirely from scratch‚Äîcompletely independent of LangChain or other agent frameworks. CrewAI empowers developers with both high-level simplicity and precise low-level control, ideal for creating autonomous AI agents tailored to any scenario:

*   CrewAI Crews: Optimize for autonomy and collaborative intelligence, enabling you to create AI teams where each agent has specific roles, tools, and goals.
*   CrewAI Flows: Enable granular, event-driven control, single LLM calls for precise task orchestration and supports Crews natively.

With over 100,000 developers certified through our community courses, CrewAI is rapidly becoming the standard for enterprise-ready AI automation.

### How Crews Work

Just like a company has departments (Sales, Engineering, Marketing) working together under leadership to achieve business goals, CrewAI helps you create an organization of AI agents with specialized roles collaborating to accomplish complex tasks.

### CrewAI Framework Overview

**Component** | **Description** | **Key Features**
------- | -------- | --------
Crew | The top-level organization | ‚Ä¢ Manages AI agent teams ‚Ä¢ Oversees workflows ‚Ä¢ Ensures collaboration ‚Ä¢ Delivers outcomes
AI Agents | Specialized team members | ‚Ä¢ Have specific roles (researcher, writer) ‚Ä¢ Use designated tools ‚Ä¢ Can delegate tasks ‚Ä¢ Make autonomous decisions
Process | Workflow management system | ‚Ä¢ Defines collaboration patterns ‚Ä¢ Controls task assignments ‚Ä¢ Manages interactions ‚Ä¢ Ensures efficient execution
Tasks | Individual assignments | ‚Ä¢ Have clear objectives ‚Ä¢ Use specific tools ‚Ä¢ Feed into larger process ‚Ä¢ Produce actionable results

### How It All Works Together

1.  The Crew organizes the overall operation
2.  AI Agents work on their specialized tasks
3.  The Process ensures smooth collaboration
4.  Tasks get completed to achieve the goal

### Key Features

## LangChain: Introduction

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

LangChain simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle:

*   Development: Build your applications using LangChain's open-source components and third-party integrations. Use LangGraph to build stateful agents with first-class streaming and human-in-the-loop support.
*   Productionization: Use LangSmith to inspect, monitor and evaluate your applications, so that you can continuously optimize and deploy with confidence.
*   Deployment: Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready APIs and Assistants with LangGraph Platform.

LangChain implements a standard interface for large language models and related technologies, such as embedding models and vector stores, and integrates with hundreds of providers. See the integrations page for more.

```python
pip install -qU "langchain[openai]"

import getpass
import os

if not os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"):
  os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter API key for OpenAI: ")

from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

model = init_chat_model("gpt-4o-mini", model_provider="openai")

model.invoke("Hello, world!")
```
