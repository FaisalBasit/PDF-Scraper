### Combined Overview of AI in Brain Tumor Imaging

Both papers address the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in brain tumor imaging. The first paper, "Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging" (Chukwujindu et al., 2024), provides a broad review of how AI, specifically machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), can assist in various aspects of brain tumor imaging, including lesion detection, differential diagnosis, segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and pseudo-progression evaluation. It also explores AI applications in non-glioma brain tumors and discusses challenges in AI implementation.

The second paper, "An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review" (Das et al., 2022), focuses more specifically on AI-based brain tumor segmentation (BTS) and analyzes the risk of bias (RoB) in different DL architectures. It categorizes DL studies into CNN-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures and evaluates these architectures considering various AI attributes.

### Similarities

*   **Focus on Deep Learning:** Both papers acknowledge the significant role of deep learning (DL) as a primary AI technique for brain tumor imaging.
*   **Importance of MRI:** Both papers recognize Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) as a crucial modality for brain tumor diagnosis and segmentation.
*   **Segmentation as a Key Application:** Both papers highlight brain tumor segmentation as an important application of AI in neuro-oncology.
*   **Challenges in Implementation:** Both papers mention the challenges associated with implementing AI in radiology, including the need for high-quality data, seamless workflow integration, and generalizability.
