**Combined Overview**

Both papers address the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in brain tumor imaging. The first paper, "Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging" by Chukwujindu et al. (2024), provides a broad overview of AI techniques, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), and their applications in various aspects of brain tumor imaging, such as lesion detection, differential diagnosis, segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and pseudo-progression evaluation. It also touches on AI applications in non-glioma brain tumors and discusses the challenges of AI implementation in radiology.

The second paper, "An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review" by Das et al. (2022), focuses specifically on brain tumor segmentation (BTS) using AI, with a particular emphasis on deep learning (DL) models. It categorizes DL studies into CNN-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures. The paper also analyzes the risk of bias (RoB) in AI models for BTS and provides recommendations for lowering this bias.

**Detailed Extraction and Alignment**

**Paper 1: Role of artificial intelligence in brain tumour imaging (Chukwujindu et al., 2024)**

*   **Abstract:** AI is rapidly evolving with many neuro-oncology applications. This review discusses how AI can assist in brain tumor imaging, focusing on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). It covers lesion detection, differential diagnosis, anatomic segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and pseudo-progression evaluation, as well as AI applications in non-glioma brain tumors. It highlights the challenges and limitations of AI implementation in radiology. AI can potentially improve the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors and provide a path towards personalized medicine.
*   **Introduction:** Brain tumors are a significant cause of mortality, with diagnosis relying on neuroimaging (CT or MRI). Gliomas are the most common CNS neoplasms, and accurate grading is crucial. AI can swiftly diagnose tumors. The article aims to evaluate the various uses of AI-assisted tools in the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors, with a unique focus on brain gliomas as well as non-glioma evaluations, and transformer-based networks in brain tumour imaging.
*   **Machine Learning:** ML incorporates algorithms and statistical models to make predictions about new data points. DL is a subclass of ML that processes raw unstructured data using multi-layered artificial neural networks (ANN).
*   **AI in Image Analysis:** AI is commonly applied in diagnostic imaging, transforming raw visual data into a format comprehensible to deep learning models like CNNs or ViTs.
*   **Lesion Detection and Grade Prediction:** AI can improve diagnosis of small lesions using MRI, CT and PET scan data.
*   **Non-Glioma Evaluation:** Non-glioma brain tumours include metastatic tumours, meningiomas, pituitary tumours, ependymomas, medulloblastomas, hemangioblastomas, and others, each requiring accurate classification for improved treatment.
*   **Transformer-Based Neural Networks:** Transformers, initially used in natural language processing, have expanded to neuro-oncology imaging, offering advancements in brain tumor diagnosis, classification and treatment.
*   **Challenges:** Implementing AI in radiology faces challenges including the need for high-quality data, seamless integration into workflows, and generalizable, interpretable, and robust methods.
*   **Conclusion:** AI-driven extraction of imaging features is transforming radiological image analysis from qualitative interpretation to an objective, quantifiable, and reproducible task. AI development can improve diagnostic accuracy, particularly for detecting small metastatic brain lesions.

**Paper 2: An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review (Das et al., 2022)**

*   **Abstract:** AI is a prominent technique for medical diagnosis and detecting brain tumors. This review focuses on linking risk-of-bias (RoB) and different AI-based architectural clusters in popular DL frameworks. The study uses a PRISMA strategy based on 75 relevant studies categorized into convolutional neural network (CNN)-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based architectures. These studies were analyzed considering 32 AI attributes. ED-based models had the lowest AI bias for BLS. This study presents a set of three primary and six secondary recommendations for lowering the RoB.
*   **Introduction:** Brain tumors are a life-threatening cancer. Medical imaging, particularly MRI, is crucial for diagnosis. Gliomas are categorized into low-grade glioma (LGG) and high-grade glioma (HGG), with HGG segmentation being challenging. An accurate and fast brain tumor segmentation (BTS) method is needed. ML and DL differ in how they derive features, with DL models offering advantages for widespread datasets. This review presents a statistical analysis of BLS in DL technology and classifies DL-based segmentation models into four categories (CNN-based, ED-based, TL-based, HDL-based), performing a depth-wise bias analysis of these models.
*   **PRISMA Model Design:** A search was carried out on PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus using keywords related to brain tumor segmentation and deep learning.
*   **AI Architecture:** This section presents a brief outline of different generations of segmentation techniques used in brain lesion segmentation (BLS).
*   **Risk-of-Bias Estimation:** A detailed study on the behavior of the models used by different authors is performed by computing the bias studies of all articles and analyzing them to make recommendations.
*   **Critical Discussion:** The proposed study presented a narrative review for BTS using AI-based DL, describing the search strategy using the PRISMA model, followed by the statistical analysis of AI attributes.
*   **Conclusion:** DL is the most recent efficient AI technique in BTS due to its automatic feature extraction. Articles that employed four different DL architectural models were reviewed (CNN-based, ED-based, TL-based, and HDL-based), utilizing a certain operation performed in each model for BLS. A statistical depth analysis was carried out.
