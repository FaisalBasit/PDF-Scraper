## A Comparative Review of AI Applications and Bias in Brain Tumor Imaging

### Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is rapidly transforming medical imaging. Brain tumor imaging, a critical component of diagnosis and treatment planning, stands to benefit significantly from these advancements. This review compares two research papers that address different facets of AI applications in this domain. The first paper, "Role of Artificial Intelligence in Brain Tumour Imaging" (European Journal of Radiology), offers a broad overview of AI's potential across various stages of brain tumor management. The second paper, "An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review," delves specifically into brain tumor segmentation (BTS), analyzing the risk of bias (RoB) associated with different DL architectures. Both papers recognize the transformative potential of AI, but they differ in scope, focus, and methodological approach.

### Comparison of Methodologies and Scope

Both papers are review articles, synthesizing existing literature to provide insights into the application of AI in brain tumor imaging. However, their methodologies and scope diverge considerably. The first paper provides a general overview, encompassing AI applications in lesion detection, differential diagnosis, anatomic segmentation, molecular marker identification, prognostication, and pseudo-progression evaluation. It also considers applications in both glioma and non-glioma tumors. In contrast, the second paper adopts a more focused and systematic approach, utilizing the PRISMA strategy to select 75 relevant studies from PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. This paper concentrates specifically on brain tumor segmentation (BTS) and performs a detailed analysis of potential biases in different DL architectures, categorizing them into CNN-based, encoder-decoder (ED)-based, transfer learning (TL)-based, and hybrid DL (HDL)-based models. The second paper assesses these studies based on 32 AI attributes and employs a ranking score method (RSM) to quantify the risk of bias. This detailed bias analysis is a significant point of departure from the first paper, which acknowledges challenges in AI implementation but does not perform a systematic assessment of bias.

### Analysis of Findings and Conclusions

The first paper highlights several key findings regarding the application of AI in brain tumor imaging. It suggests that AI can enhance the diagnosis of small lesions and facilitate early and accurate treatment planning. Furthermore, it emphasizes AI's ability to transform radiological image analysis from qualitative to objective and quantifiable tasks. The paper concludes that AI has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy, treatment planning, and personalized medicine in the context of brain tumors. It also acknowledges the importance of computer-aided detection (CAD) tools and AI-driven feature extraction as key advancements. For example, the ability to detect subtle changes indicative of pseudo-progression, as discussed by the review, can significantly impact treatment strategies, potentially preventing unnecessary interventions.

The second paper's findings are more specific to brain tumor segmentation and the biases inherent in different DL architectures. The review concludes that DL is an efficient AI technique for BTS due to its automatic feature extraction capabilities. The study's comparative analysis of architectural models reveals that transfer learning (TL)-based architectures generally outperform other models, while encoder-decoder (ED)-based models exhibit the lowest AI bias for BLS. These findings provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to develop and implement AI-based BTS solutions, highlighting the importance of considering architectural choices and their potential impact on bias. The second paper also provides primary and secondary recommendations for lowering the risk of bias, offering practical guidance for improving the reliability and validity of AI-based BTS models.

### Contradictions, Gaps, and Future Research Implications

While both papers contribute valuable insights, there are some inherent contradictions and gaps that warrant further discussion. The first paper, with its broad scope, paints a generally optimistic picture of AI's potential in brain tumor imaging. However, it does not delve deeply into the potential pitfalls and limitations of AI, such as the risk of bias and the challenges of ensuring generalizability across diverse patient populations and imaging protocols. The second paper addresses this gap by specifically focusing on the risk of bias in BTS models. However, its narrow focus on segmentation limits its ability to provide a comprehensive overview of AI applications across the entire spectrum of brain tumor management.

One potential contradiction lies in the implied prioritization of different DL architectures. While the first paper broadly alludes to the utility of various ML and DL techniques, including transformer-based networks, the second paper provides a more granular ranking of architectures based on performance and bias. This suggests that certain architectures, such as TL-based and ED-based models, may be more suitable for BTS than others. However, further research is needed to validate these findings and to explore the optimal architectural choices for different AI-based tasks in brain tumor imaging.

Future research should focus on addressing these gaps and contradictions. Specifically, there is a need for studies that comprehensively evaluate the performance and bias of different AI models across a wide range of brain tumor imaging tasks. Furthermore, research should explore methods for mitigating bias and ensuring the generalizability of AI models to diverse patient populations and imaging protocols. There is also a need for more robust validation studies that assess the clinical utility of AI-based tools in real-world settings. As suggested by Tandel et al. (Jul. 2020), the development of standardized datasets and evaluation metrics is crucial for facilitating the development and validation of AI models in brain tumor imaging.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, both "Role of Artificial Intelligence in Brain Tumour Imaging" and "An artificial intelligence framework and its bias for brain tumor segmentation: A narrative review" provide valuable insights into the application of AI in brain tumor imaging. While the first paper offers a broad overview of AI's potential across various stages of brain tumor management, the second paper provides a more focused and systematic analysis of the risk of bias in brain tumor segmentation models. Both papers highlight the transformative potential of AI, but they also underscore the importance of addressing the challenges and limitations associated with AI implementation. By synthesizing the findings of these two papers, this review provides a more comprehensive understanding of the current state of AI in brain tumor imaging and identifies key areas for future research. Ultimately, the successful integration of AI into clinical practice will require a multidisciplinary approach that combines technical expertise with clinical knowledge and a commitment to ensuring the reliability, validity, and fairness of AI-based tools. As Rowe (Oct. 2019) and others have suggested, ethical considerations and regulatory frameworks will also play a crucial role in shaping the future of AI in brain tumor imaging.
